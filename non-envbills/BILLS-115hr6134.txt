Act (8 U.S.C. 1357(d)) is amended to read as follows:
    ``(d) Detainer of Inadmissible or Deportable Aliens.--
            ``(1) In general.--In the case of an individual who is 
        arrested by any Federal, State, or local law enforcement 
        official or other personnel for the alleged violation of any 
        criminal or motor vehicle law relating to driving while 
        intoxicated or driving under the influence (including driving 
        while under the influence of or impairment by alcohol or 
        drugs), the Secretary may issue a detainer regarding the 
        individual to any Federal, State, or local law enforcement 
        entity, official, or other personnel if the Secretary has 
        probable cause to believe that the individual is an 
        inadmissible or deportable alien.
            ``(2) Probable cause.--Probable cause is deemed to be 
        established if--
                    ``(A) the individual who is the subject of the

                other Federal database records, the identity of an 
                alien who the Secretary has reasonable grounds to

                been served;
                    ``(C) the individual who is the subject of the 
                detainer has previously been ordered removed from the 
                United States and such an order is administratively 
                final;

                detainer has made voluntary statements or provided 
                reliable evidence that indicate that they are an 
                inadmissible or deportable alien; or

                subject of the detainer is an inadmissible or 
                deportable alien.

        detainer is issued complies with the detainer and detains for 
        purposes of transfer of custody to the Department of Homeland 
        Security the individual who is the subject of the detainer, the 
        Department may take custody of the individual within 48 hours 
        (excluding weekends and holidays), but in no instance more than 
        96 hours, following the date that the individual is otherwise 
        to be released from the custody of the relevant Federal, State, 
        or local law enforcement entity.''.
    (b) Immunity.--
            (1) In general.--A State or a political subdivision of a 
        State (and the officials and personnel of the State or 
        subdivision acting in their official capacities), and a 
        nongovernmental entity (and its personnel) contracted by the 
        State or political subdivision for the purpose of providing 
        detention, acting in compliance with a Department of Homeland 
        Security detainer issued pursuant to this section who 
        temporarily holds an alien in its custody pursuant to the terms 
        of a detainer so that the alien may be taken into the custody 
        of the Department of Homeland Security, shall be considered to 
        be acting under color of Federal authority for purposes of 
        determining their liability and shall be held harmless for 
        their compliance with the detainer in any suit seeking any 
        punitive, compensatory, or other monetary damages.
            (2) Federal government as defendant.--In any civil action 
        arising out of the compliance with a Department of Homeland 
        Security detainer by a State or a political subdivision of a 
        State (and the officials and personnel of the State or 
        subdivision acting in their official capacities), or a 
        nongovernmental entity (and its personnel) contracted by the 
        State or political subdivision for the purpose of providing 
        detention, the United States Government shall be the proper 
        party named as the defendant in the suit in regard to the 
        detention resulting from compliance with the detainer.
            (3) Bad faith exception.--Paragraphs (1) and (2) shall not 
        apply to any mistreatment of an individual by a State or a 
        political subdivision of a State (and the officials and 
        personnel of the State or subdivision acting in their official 
        capacities), or a nongovernmental entity (and its personnel)

        purpose of providing detention.
    (c) Private Right of Action.--
            (1) Cause of action.--Any individual, or a spouse, parent, 
        or child of that individual (if the individual is deceased), 
        who is the victim of a murder, rape, or any felony, as defined 
        by the State, for which an alien (as defined in section 
        101(a)(3) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 
        1101(a)(3))) has been convicted and sentenced to a term of 
        imprisonment of at least 1 year, may bring an action against a 
        State or political subdivision of a State or public official 
        acting in an official capacity in the appropriate Federal court 
        if the State or political subdivision, except as provided in 
        paragraph (3)--
                    (A) released the alien from custody prior to the 
                commission of such crime as a consequence of the State 
                or political subdivision's declining to honor a 
                detainer issued pursuant to section 287(d)(1) of the 
                Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1357(d)(1));
                    (B) has in effect a statute, policy, or practice 
                not in compliance with section 642 of the Illegal 
                Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 
                1996 (8 U.S.C. 1373) as amended, and as a consequence 
                of its statute, policy, or practice, released the alien 
                from custody prior to the commission of such crime; or
                    (C) has in effect a statute, policy, or practice 
                requiring a subordinate political subdivision to 
                decline to honor any or all detainers issued pursuant 
                to section 287(d)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality 
                Act (8 U.S.C. 1357(d)(1)), and, as a consequence of its 
                statute, policy or practice, the subordinate political 
                subdivision declined to honor a detainer issued 
                pursuant to such section, and as a consequence released 
                the alien from custody prior to the commission of such 
                crime.
            (2) Limitations on bringing action.--An action may not be 
        brought under this subsection later than 10 years following the 
        occurrence of the crime, or death of a person as a result of 
        such crime, whichever occurs later.
            (3) Proper defendant.--If a political subdivision of a 
        State declines to honor a detainer issued pursuant to section 
        287(d)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 
        1357(d)) as a consequence of the State or another political 
        subdivision with jurisdiction over the subdivision prohibiting 
        the subdivision through a statute or other legal requirement of 
        the State or other political subdivision--
                    (A) from honoring the detainer; or
                    (B) fully complying with section 642 of the Illegal 
                Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 
                1996 (8 U.S.C. 1373),
        and, as a consequence of the statute or other legal requirement 
        of the State or other political subdivision, the subdivision 
        released the alien referred to in paragraph (1) from custody 
        prior to the commission of the crime referred to in that 
        paragraph, the State or other political subdivision that 
        enacted the statute or other legal requirement, shall be deemed 
        to be the proper defendant in a cause of action under this 
        subsection, and no such cause of action may be maintained 
        against the political subdivision which declined to honor the 
        detainer.
            (4) Attorney's fee and other costs.--In any action or 
        proceeding under this subsection the court shall allow a 
        prevailing plaintiff a reasonable attorneys fee as part of the

                alien last habitually resided, and who applied for such
