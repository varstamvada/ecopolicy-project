                                 A BILL


 
   To empower States with authority for most taxing and spending for 
  highway programs and mass transit programs, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Transportation Empowerment Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) the objective of the Federal highway program has been 
        to facilitate the construction of a modern freeway system that 
        promotes efficient interstate commerce by connecting all 
        States;
            (2) that objective has been attained, and the Interstate 
        System connecting all States is near completion;
            (3) each State has the responsibility of providing an 
        efficient transportation network for the residents of the 
        State;
            (4) each State has the means to build and operate a network 
        of transportation systems, including highways, that best serves 
        the needs of the State;
            (5) each State is best capable of determining the needs of 
        the State and acting on those needs;
            (6) the Federal role in highway transportation has, over 
        time, usurped the role of the States by taxing fuels used in 
        the States and then distributing the proceeds to the States 
        based on the Federal Government's perceptions of what is best 
        for the States;
            (7) the Federal Government has used the Federal gasoline 
        tax revenues to force all States to take actions that are not 
        necessarily appropriate for individual States;
            (8) the Federal distribution, review, and enforcement 
        process wastes billions of dollars on unproductive activities;
            (9) Federal mandates that apply uniformly to all 50 States, 
        regardless of the different circumstances of the States, cause 
        the States to waste billions of hard-earned tax dollars on 
        projects, programs, and activities that the States would not 
        otherwise undertake; and
            (10) Congress has expressed a strong interest in reducing 
        the role of the Federal Government by allowing each State to 
        manage its own affairs.
    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--
            (1) to return to the individual States maximum 
        discretionary authority and fiscal responsibility for all 
        elements of the national surface transportation systems that 
        are not within the direct purview of the Federal Government;
            (2) to preserve Federal responsibility for the Dwight D. 
        Eisenhower National System of Interstate and Defense Highways;
            (3) to preserve the responsibility of the Department of 
        Transportation for--
                    (A) design, construction, and preservation of 
                transportation facilities on Federal public land;
                    (B) national programs of transportation research 
                and development and transportation safety; and
                    (C) emergency assistance to the States in response 
                to natural disasters;
            (4) to eliminate to the maximum extent practicable Federal 
        obstacles to the ability of each State to apply innovative 
        solutions to the financing, design, construction, operation, 
        and preservation of Federal and State transportation 
        facilities; and
            (5) with respect to transportation activities carried out 
        by States, local governments, and the private sector, to 
        encourage--
                    (A) competition among States, local governments, 
                and the private sector; and
                    (B) innovation, energy efficiency, private sector 
                participation, and productivity.

        the Office of Management and Budget certifies that this Act is 
        deficit neutral;
            (2) discretionary spending limits are reduced to capture 
        the savings realized in devolving transportation functions to 
        the State level pursuant to this Act; and
            (3) the tax reduction made by this Act is not scored under 
        pay-as-you-go and does not inadvertently trigger a 
        sequestration.
    (b) Effective Date Contingency.--Notwithstanding any other 
provision of this Act, this Act and the amendments made by this Act 
shall take effect only if--
            (1) the Director of the Office of Management and Budget 
        (referred to in this section as the ``Director'') submits the 
        report as required in subsection (c); and
            (2) the report contains a certification by the Director 
        that, based on the required estimates, the reduction in 
        discretionary outlays resulting from the reduction in contract 
        authority is at least as great as the reduction in revenues for 
        each fiscal year through fiscal year 2009.
    (c) OMB Estimates and Report.--
            (1) Requirements.--Not later than 5 calendar days after the

                2009;
                    (B) estimate the net change in discretionary 
                outlays resulting from the reduction in contract 
                authority under this Act for each fiscal year through 
                fiscal year 2009;
                    (C) determine, based on those estimates, whether 
                the reduction in discretionary outlays is at least as 
                great as the reduction in revenues for each fiscal year 
                through fiscal year 2009; and
                    (D) submit to Congress a report setting forth the 
                estimates and determination.
            (2) Applicable assumptions and guidelines.--
                    (A) Revenue estimates.--The revenue estimates 
                required under paragraph (1)(A) shall be predicated on 
                the same economic and technical assumptions and 
                scorekeeping guidelines that would be used for 
                estimates made pursuant to section 252(d) of the 
                Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 
                1985 (2 U.S.C. 902(d)).
                    (B) Outlay estimates.--The outlay estimates 
                required under paragraph (1)(B) shall be determined by 
                comparing the level of discretionary outlays resulting 
                from this Act with the corresponding level of 
                discretionary outlays projected in the baseline under 
                section 257 of the Balanced Budget and Emergency 
                Deficit Control Act of 1985 (2 U.S.C. 907).
