                               RESOLUTION


 
 Expressing concern regarding the prevalence of hexavalent chromium in 
                  drinking water in the United States.

Whereas hexavalent chromium, also referred to as chromium-6, was found at 
        elevated levels in the drinking water sources of over 200,000,000 
        Americans in all 50 States;
Whereas in 2008, the National Toxicology Program found that ingestion of 
        hexavalent chromium was shown to cause increased incidences of cancer in 
        laboratory rats and mice;
Whereas in 2010, the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment 
        set a public health goal for hexavalent chromium of 0.02 parts per 
        billion in drinking water;
Whereas in 2010, New Jersey's Drinking Water Quality Institute drafted a health-
        based maximum contaminant level for hexavalent chromium of 0.07 parts 
        per billion in drinking water;
Whereas in 2016, the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services 
        established a health based screening level for hexavalent chromium of 
        0.07 parts per billion in drinking water;
Whereas between 2014 and 2016, the levels of hexavalent chromium in test results 
        collected by the Environmental Protection Agency for the zip code 77099 
        contained areas that exceeded 6.0 parts per billion based on analysis 
        from the Environmental Working Group, one of the leading environmental 
        research organizations in the United States;
Whereas the Environmental Protection Agency is in the process of drafting a 
        toxicological review of acceptable levels of hexavalent chromium found 
        in drinking water; and
Whereas all Americans deserve access to clean drinking water: Now, therefore, be 
        it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) recognizes the importance of protecting the American 
        people from drinking water polluted with carcinogens;
            (2) encourages State and local governments to collaborate 
        and set reasonable standards for hexavalent chromium in 
        drinking water to ensure the safety of their constituents;
            (3) encourages the Environmental Protection Agency to 
        complete their health review and establish standards for 
        hexavalent chromium found in drinking water;
            (4) encourages consideration of a tax break for persons 
        living in areas that exceed standards established by the 
        Environmental Protection Agency who purchase a filtration 
        system to mitigate the effects of hexavalent chromium; and
            (5) encourages appropriate agencies at all levels of 
        government to determine the causes of harmful levels of 
        hexavalent chromium and take appropriate mitigation actions.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
