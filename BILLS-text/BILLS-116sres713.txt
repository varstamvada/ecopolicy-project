                               RESOLUTION


 
     Expressing the sense of the Senate that the August 13, 2020, 
announcement of the establishment of full diplomatic relations between 
the State of Israel and the United Arab Emirates and the September 11, 
 2020, announcement of the establishment of full diplomatic relations 
 between the State of Israel and the Kingdom of Bahrain is a historic 
                              achievement.

Whereas President Donald J. Trump, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, 
        and other world leaders have worked tirelessly to announce agreements on 
        the full normalization of relations between Israel and other nations;
Whereas the United Arab Emirates and the Kingdom of Bahrain have been the first 
        Arab states to announce formal relations with Israel;
Whereas, under the agreements, the two countries agree to the establishment of 
        reciprocal embassies and the exchange of Ambassadors;
Whereas opening direct ties between Israel and the United Arab Emirates and 
        between Israel and Bahrain could begin to transform the region by 
        spurring economic growth, enhancing technological innovation, and 
        forging closer people-to-people relations;
Whereas these agreements could promote investment, tourism, direct flights, 
        security, telecommunications, technology, energy, healthcare, culture, 
        and the environment;
Whereas the United States, Israel, the United Arab Emirates, and Bahrain share a 
        commitment to promoting stability through diplomatic engagement, 
        increased economic integration, and closer security coordination;
Whereas Israel, the United Arab Emirates, and Bahrain will partner with the 
        United States to launch a Strategic Agenda for the Middle East to expand 
        diplomatic, trade, and security cooperation;
Whereas these historic agreements could help advance peace between Israel and 
        other Arab nations;
Whereas these bilateral breakthroughs could set a precedent for further 
        diplomatic openings throughout the region;
Whereas support for peace between Israel and its neighbors has longstanding 
        bipartisan support in Congress and among the American people; and
Whereas the agreements build upon the decades-long leadership of the United 
        States in helping Israel broker peace treaties with Egypt and Jordan and 
        promoting peace talks between Israel and Syria, Lebanon, and the 
        Palestinians: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) congratulates the Governments and people of Israel and 
        the United Arab Emirates and the Governments and people of 
        Israel and Bahrain on reaching their respective historic 
        agreements;
            (2) encourages other Arab nations to establish full 
        relations with Israel with the vision of realizing full peace 
        between Israel and all of its Arab neighbors; and
            (3) urges the President to continue to engage with the 
        Government of Israel and the United States Arab partners in 
        reaching these historic agreements.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
