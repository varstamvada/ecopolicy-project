Honoring the life of Paul M. Weyrich and expressing the condolences of 
                       the Senate on his passing.

Whereas Paul M. Weyrich was born and raised in Racine, Wisconsin and became 
        enamored with the political system as a student at the University of 
        Wisconsin-Madison;
Whereas after a short stint as a news reporter, Mr. Weyrich came to Congress in 
        1966 to serve on the staffs of Senators Gordon L. Allott of Colorado and 
        Carl T. Curtis of Nebraska, handling press relations and other 
        assignments;
Whereas as the original President of the Heritage Foundation, Mr. Weyrich 
        established a respectable and reasoned conservative voice in public 
        policy and political debates in the United States;
Whereas as a pioneer of the modern conservative movement, Mr. Weyrich stood as a 
        vocal defender of economic and religious freedom and established the 
        Free Congress Research and Education Foundation to rally conservatives 
        to the defense of traditional Judeo-Christian values;
Whereas Mr. Weyrich died on December 18, 2008;
Whereas Mr. Weyrich was a true visionary in outreach efforts, launching a 
        television network, training grassroots activists, and influencing both 
        politics and policy; and
Whereas Mr. Weyrich's perseverance in the promotion of his philosophy inspired 
        thousands of people of the United States to dedicate themselves to 
        causes that protect liberty and secure the future of the United States: 
        Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) expresses gratitude to Paul M. Weyrich for his 
        significant contributions to the conservative movement and for 
        promoting a capitalist, democratic vision for the world;
            (2) expresses profound sorrow at the death of Mr. Weyrich; 
        and
            (3) conveys its condolences to the family, friends, and 
        colleagues of Mr. Weyrich.
