                                 A BILL


 
   To prohibit the use of funds for the operation or construction of 
           family detention centers, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Freedom for Families Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The Federal Government has intentionally separated and 
        detained families seeking asylum in the United States 
        purportedly to deter other foreign nationals from coming to the 
        United States in the future. Such method of deterrence is 
        ineffective, contrary to human rights norms, and likely 
        violates United States and international law.
            (2) On September 7, 2018, the Secretary of Homeland 
        Security issued a proposed rule entitled ``Apprehension, 
        Processing, Care, and Custody of Alien Minors and Unaccompanied 
        Alien Children'' (83 Fed. Reg. 45486 (September 7, 2018)) that 
        attempted to circumvent a 1997 court agreement commonly known 
        as the ``Flores Settlement Agreement'' to undermine current 
        legal protections for children and families and increase family 
        detention.
            (3) Detaining families can have long-term consequences on 
        children, such as--
                    (A) difficulty regulating emotions, achieving 
                developmental milestones, and forming healthy 
                relationships;
                    (B) increased rates of anxiety, depression, and 
                post-traumatic stress disorder; and
                    (C) heightened risks of suicide and self-harm.
            (4) When family units are placed in family detention 
        facilities--
                    (A) family members experience feelings of isolation 
                and increased stress;
                    (B) the ability of the parents to care for their 
                children is compromised by the constraints of 
                detention; and
                    (C) the detention setting creates barriers to--
                            (i) accessing counsel and legal services; 
                        and
                            (ii) successfully obtaining relief from 
                        removal.
            (5) Nondetention-based practices, such as family case 
        management and community-based programs, are effective and 
        humane alternatives to family detention.
