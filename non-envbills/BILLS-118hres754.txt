                               RESOLUTION


 
Recognizing the heritage, culture, and contributions of Latinas in the 
                             United States.

Whereas the United States celebrates National Women's History Month every March 
        to recognize and honor the achievements of women throughout the history 
        of the United States;
Whereas there are nearly 30,000,000 Latinas living in the United States;
Whereas 1 in 6 women in the United States is a Latina;
Whereas Latinas have helped shape the history of the United States since its 
        inception;
Whereas Latinas contribute to the society of the United States through working 
        in many industries, including business, education, science and 
        technology, medicine, engineering, mathematics, literature and the arts, 
        the military, agriculture, hospitality, and public service;
Whereas Latinas served as essential workers during the COVID-19 pandemic, 
        filling vital positions that keep the economy going and the people of 
        the United States safe;
Whereas Latinas come from diverse cultures across North America, Central 
        America, South America, and the Caribbean, and Afro-Latinas face 
        disparities in recognition;
Whereas Latinas are dedicated public servants, holding posts at the highest 
        levels of the Federal Government, including the Supreme Court of the 
        United States, Cabinet-level positions, the United States Senate, and 
        the United States House of Representatives;
Whereas there are approximately 45,710 active duty Latinas in the Armed Forces, 
        and the first Latina to become a general in the Marine Corps reached 
        that rank in 2006;
Whereas Latinas are breaking the glass ceiling in science, technology, 
        engineering, and mathematics, with the first Latina to travel into space 
        doing so during a 9-day Space Shuttle Discovery mission in 1993;
Whereas Latinas own more than 2,000,000 businesses, and 18 percent of all women-
        owned companies in the United States are owned by a Latina;
Whereas Latina activists have led the fight for civil rights, including labor 
        rights, LGBTQ rights, women's rights, and racial equality;
Whereas Latinas like Hollywood icon Raquel Welch have created award-winning art;
Whereas Latinas are recipients of Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, and Tony awards, 
        including Rita Moreno, who earned all 4 awards between 1961 and 1977;
Whereas Latina singers and songwriters, such as Selena, Celia Cruz, Shakira, and 
        Linda Ronstadt, have made lasting and significant contributions to music 
        throughout the world;
Whereas Latinas serve in the medical profession, and the first female and first 
        Hispanic Surgeon General of the United States was appointed in 1990;
Whereas Latinas serve as journalists, reporting vital news and information to 
        the public;
Whereas Latinas are world-class athletes, representing the United States in the 
        Olympics and other international competitions;
Whereas Latinas are paid just 57 cents for every dollar paid to White, non-
        Hispanic men, and Latinas will not achieve equal pay at the current rate 
        for another 432 years;
Whereas, in the face of societal obstacles, including unequal pay, disparities 
        in education, health care needs, and civil rights struggles, Latinas 
        continue to break through and thrive;
Whereas the United States should continue to invest in the future of Latinas to 
        address the barriers they face; and
Whereas, by 2060, Latinas will represent \1/4\ of the female population of the 
        United States: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) celebrates and honors the successes of Latinas and the 
        contributions they have made and continue to make to the United 
        States; and
            (2) recognizes the changes that are still to be made to 
        ensure that Latinas can realize their full potential as equal 
        members of society.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
