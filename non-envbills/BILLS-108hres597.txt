                               RESOLUTION


 
Congratulating the American Library Association (ALA) as it celebrates 
    its first annual National Library Workers Day on April 20, 2004.

Whereas the American Library Association (ALA) is dedicated to enriching the 
        lives of people of all ages throughout the United States;
Whereas the ALA represents more than 64,000 library workers and library 
        supporters who are committed to serving communities in rural, urban, and 
        suburban neighborhoods, and in public, school, academic, and special 
        libraries;
Whereas the lives of millions of young children have been touched by the 
        devotion and professionalism of librarians;
Whereas there are currently more than 117,000 public libraries nationwide that 
        serve a diverse clientele;
Whereas more than 400,000 people on a daily basis depend on public libraries to 
        conduct research and borrow materials;
Whereas librarians play a critical role in educating students of all ages by 
        maintaining a comprehensive catalog of books, electronic resources, 
        online databases, journals, newspaper articles, microforms, and 
        historical documents;
Whereas the 21st Century Literacy program is one of five key action areas 
        adopted by the American Library Association to fulfill its mission of 
        providing the highest quality library and information services for all 
        people;
Whereas the ALA is committed to helping children and adults develop the 
        necessary skills to compete in today's global economy;
Whereas libraries are facing drastic budget cuts at the local, State, and 
        Federal level yet continue to provide quality service;
Whereas the ``Campaign to Save America's Libraries'' has fought to increase 
        funding for libraries in dire need of new equipment;
Whereas the mission of the ALA is to ``provide leadership for the development, 
        promotion and improvement of library and information services and the 
        profession of librarianship in order to enhance learning and ensure 
        access to information for all'';
Whereas the ALA is committed to diversity by actively recruiting people from all 
        ethnic backgrounds to fill key positions;
Whereas the ALA actively defends the right of library users to seek and receive 
        information freely as guaranteed by the First Amendment; and
Whereas America's library workers are the knowledge navigators and the 21st 
        century information specialists who have served America's populace with 
        dedication and excellence, but for all too long have been underpaid and 
        have not enjoyed the status and compensation appropriate to their 
        education, experience, and expertise: Now, therefore be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) recognizes the important role librarians play in 
        educating citizens of all ages;
            (2) urges members of both parties to support dramatic 
        increases in funding for libraries;
            (3) recognizes that librarians hold the key to unlocking 
        the potential of students from various socioeconomic 
        backgrounds;
            (4) supports the American Library Association's fight to 
        equip libraries with up-to-date technology;
            (5) recognizes that librarians are the key to expanding 
        opportunities for all students and families; and
            (6) concludes that--
                    (A) the necessity for continuing education in our 
                complex world requires an expanding role for libraries 
                as we provide our users with information relative to 
                maintaining prosperity, improving civic competence, 
                providing homeland security and promoting peace; and
                    (B) the people who work in libraries should be 
                compensated at a level comparable to this 
                extraordinarily important role they play in helping 
                Americans meet these information needs so crucial to 
                the functioning of our great democracy.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
