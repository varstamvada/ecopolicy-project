                               RESOLUTION


 
  Expressing support for the designation of Cesar Chavez's birthday, 
            March 31, 2019, as National Border Control Day.

Whereas Cesar Chavez was born on March 31, 1927, in Yuma, Arizona;
Whereas, in 1962, Chavez founded the National Farm Workers Association, which 
        later became the United Farm Workers, to improve the wages and working 
        conditions for American farmworkers;
Whereas Chavez's union drew on the imagery of civil rights to use nonviolence 
        and mass mobilization to improve the conditions of persecuted and 
        impoverished American workers;
Whereas Cesar Chavez believed that preventing illegal immigration was an 
        essential prerequisite to improving the circumstances of American 
        farmworkers;
Whereas, in 1969, Chavez led a march to the Mexican border to protest illegal 
        immigration, joined by Senator Walter Mondale and Martin Luther King's 
        successor as head of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, Ralph 
        Abernathy;
Whereas Chavez noted that it is ``almost impossible to start some effective 
        program to get these people their jobs back from the braceros'' once 
        employers replace them;
Whereas, in the 1970s, Chavez combined a campaign of identifying and reporting 
        illegal workers with a campaign to boycott nonunionized farms in order 
        to protect the labor of the unionized American worker;
Whereas Chavez recognized that flooding the labor market with people from abroad 
        undermines the unionized American worker;
Whereas, in 1979, at the National Press Club, Chavez emphatically supported 
        enforcement of immigration laws, stating that ``people are being hurt 
        and being destroyed, and with the complicity and with the help, of the 
        Federal Government''; and
Whereas President Clinton recognized Chavez's work saying, ``We can be proud of 
        his enormous accomplishments and in the dignity and comfort he brought 
        to the lives of so many of our country's least powerful and most 
        dispossessed workers'': Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports the designation of National Border Control 
        Day;
            (2) expresses strong support for Cesar Chavez's fight to 
        defend the interests of the American farmworkers, and for his 
        recognition that nonviolent action could protect these workers 
        against the business interests which would replace them with 
        illegal foreign labor; and
            (3) encourages recognition and celebration of National 
        Border Control Day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
