110th CONGRESS
  1st Session
H. RES. 440

     Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that any 
    comprehensive plan to combat illegal immigration must increase 
     resources for border patrol, establish an instant employment 
   eligibility verification system, renew a limited temporary worker 
     program, prohibit blanket amnesty for illegal aliens who have 
 deliberately broken the law, and give priority to law-abiding, highly-
           skilled immigrants applying for legal citizenship.

                     the Committee on the Judiciary

_______________________________________________________________________

                               RESOLUTION


 
     Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that any 
    comprehensive plan to combat illegal immigration must increase 
     resources for border patrol, establish an instant employment 
   eligibility verification system, renew a limited temporary worker 
     program, prohibit blanket amnesty for illegal aliens who have 
 deliberately broken the law, and give priority to law-abiding, highly-
           skilled immigrants applying for legal citizenship.

Whereas there are more than 12,000,000 illegal aliens currently residing in the 
        United States, the highest level in history;
Whereas illegal aliens are willing to make the arduous and potentially lethal 
        journey to the United States in order to pursue economic opportunity, 
        seek reunification with family, and escape political and civil unrest;
Whereas the number of illegal aliens continues to grow significantly, increasing 
        by 500,000 annually;
Whereas, in 2005, 1,300,000 apprehensions of illegal aliens attempting to enter 
        the United States occurred along 8,000 miles of international border;
Whereas, in 2005, 453 potential illegal aliens died during their attempt to 
        cross the United States-Mexico border; and
Whereas 6,300,000 illegal aliens are estimated to be working in the United 
        States despite laws prohibiting the hiring, recruiting, referring for a 
        fee, and employment of illegal aliens: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved,  That it is the sense of the House of Representatives 
that to deter further illegal immigration and strengthen the economy of 
the United States the following must be included in any immigration 
bill considered by the 110th Congress:
            (1) Increased resources for Federal and State authorities 
        to strengthen border patrol efforts.
            (2) A vigorous prohibition of the hiring of illegal aliens 
        coupled with the establishment of an instant employment 
        eligibility verification system.
            (3) A renewed and limited temporary worker program to allow 
        a certain, but not unlimited, number of documented foreign 
        workers to live in the country legally for a fixed amount of 
        time.
            (4) A prohibition of blanket amnesty for illegal aliens who 
        have deliberately broken the law that does not harm the 
        innocent victims of circumstance.
            (5) A priority given to law-abiding, highly-skilled 
        immigrants applying for legal entry.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
