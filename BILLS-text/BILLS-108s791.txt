                gasoline use area and each reformulated gasoline use 
                area in each State, a survey to determine the market 
                shares of--

            (2) Recordkeeping and reporting requirements.--
                    (A) In general.--The Administrator may require any 
                refiner, blender, or importer to keep such records and 
                make such reports as are necessary to ensure that the 
                survey conducted under paragraph (1) is accurate.
                    (B) Reliance on existing requirements.--To avoid 
                duplicative requirements, in carrying out subparagraph 
                (A), the Administrator shall rely, to the maximum 
                extent practicable, on reporting and recordkeeping 
                requirements in effect on the date of enactment of this 
                Act.
            (3) Confidentiality.--Activities carried out under this

SEC. 203. RESTRICTIONS ON THE USE OF MTBE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) since 1979, methyl tertiary butyl ether (referred to in 
        this section as ``MTBE'') has been used nationwide at low 
        levels in gasoline to replace lead as an octane booster or 
        anti-knocking agent;
            (2) Public Law 101-549 (commonly known as the ``Clean Air 
        Act Amendments of 1990'') (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.) established 
        a fuel oxygenate standard under which reformulated gasoline 
        must contain at least 2 percent oxygen by weight;
            (3) at the time of the adoption of the fuel oxygenate 
        standard, Congress was aware that--
                    (A) significant use of MTBE could result from the 
                adoption of that standard; and
                    (B) the use of MTBE would likely be important to 
                the cost-effective implementation of that standard;
            (4) Congress is aware that gasoline and its component 
        additives have leaked from storage tanks, with consequences for 
        water quality;
            (5) the fuel industry responded to the fuel oxygenate 
        standard established by Public Law 101-549 by making 
        substantial investments in--
                    (A) MTBE production capacity; and
                    (B) systems to deliver MTBE-containing gasoline to 
                the marketplace;
            (6) when leaked or spilled into the environment, MTBE may 
        cause serious problems of drinking water quality;
            (7) in recent years, MTBE has been detected in water 
        sources throughout the United States;
            (8) MTBE can be detected by smell and taste at low 
        concentrations;
            (9) while small quantities of MTBE can render water 
        supplies unpalatable, the precise human health effects of MTBE 
        consumption at low levels are yet unknown as of the date of 
        enactment of this Act;
            (10) in the report entitled ``Achieving Clean Air and Clean 
        Water: The Report of the Blue Ribbon Panel on Oxygenates in 
        Gasoline'' and dated September 1999, Congress was urged--
                    (A) to eliminate the fuel oxygenate standard;
                    (B) to greatly reduce use of MTBE; and
                    (C) to maintain the environmental performance of 
                reformulated gasoline;
            (11) Congress has--
                    (A) reconsidered the relative value of MTBE in 
                gasoline; and
                    (B) decided to eliminate use of MTBE as a fuel 
                additive;
            (12) the timeline for elimination of use of MTBE as a fuel 
        additive must be established in a manner that achieves an 
        appropriate balance among the goals of--
                    (A) environmental protection;
                    (B) adequate energy supply; and
                    (C) reasonable fuel prices; and
            (13) it is appropriate for Congress to provide some limited 
        transition assistance--
                    (A) to merchant producers of MTBE who produced MTBE 
                in response to a market created by the oxygenate 
                requirement contained in the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 
                7401 et seq.); and
                    (B) for the purpose of mitigating any fuel supply 
                problems that may result from elimination of a widely-
                used fuel additive.
    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this section are--
            (1) to eliminate use of MTBE as a fuel oxygenate; and
            (2) to provide assistance to merchant producers of MTBE in 
        making the transition from producing MTBE to producing other 
        fuel additives.
    (c) Authority for Water Quality Protection From Fuels.--Section 
211(c) of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7545(c)) is amended--
            (1) in paragraph (1)(A)--
                    (A) by inserting ``fuel or fuel additive or'' after 
                ``Administrator any''; and
                    (B) by striking ``air pollution which'' and 
                inserting ``air pollution, or water pollution, that'';
            (2) in paragraph (4)(B), by inserting ``or water quality 
        protection,'' after ``emission control,''; and
            (3) by adding at the end the following:
            ``(5) Restrictions on use of mtbe.--
                    ``(A) In general.--Subject to subparagraph (E), not 
                later than 4 years after the date of enactment of this

                motor vehicle fuel in any State other than a State 
                described in subparagraph (C) is prohibited.
                    ``(B) Regulations.--The Administrator shall

                or used in the State.
                    ``(D) Publication of notice.--The Administrator 
                shall publish in the Federal Register each notice

                exceed 0.5 percent by volume, to be present in motor 
                vehicle fuel in cases that the Administrator determines 
                to be appropriate.
