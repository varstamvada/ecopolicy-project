                   To prohibit unauthorized earmarks.

    Resolved,

SECTION 1. PROHIBITION ON UNAUTHORIZED EARMARKS.

    (a) In General.--It shall not be in order to consider a bill, joint 
resolution, conference report, or amendment that provides an earmark.
    (b) Supermajority.--
            (1) Waiver.--The provisions of subsection (a) may be waived 
        or suspended in the Senate only by the affirmative vote of 
        three-fourths of the Members, duly chosen and sworn.
            (2) Appeal.--Appeals in the Senate from the decisions of 
        the Chair relating to any provision of this section shall be 
        limited to 1 hour, to be equally divided between, and 
        controlled by, the appellant and the manager of the measure. An 
        affirmative vote of three-fourths of the Members of the Senate, 
        duly chosen and sworn, shall be required to sustain an appeal 
        of the ruling of the Chair on a point of order raised under 
        this section.
    (c) Earmark Defined.--In this resolution, the term ``earmark'' 
means a provision or report language included primarily at the request 
of a Senator or Member of the House of Representatives providing or 
recommending a specific amount of discretionary budget authority, 
credit authority, or other spending authority for a contract, loan, 
loan guarantee, grant, loan authority, or other expenditure with or to 
an entity, or targeted to a specific State, locality, or congressional 
district unless the provision or language--
            (1) is specifically authorized by an appropriate 
        congressional authorizing committee of jurisdiction;
            (2) meets funding eligibility criteria established by an 
        appropriate congressional authorizing committee of jurisdiction 
        by statute; or
            (3) is awarded through a statutory or administrative 
        formula-driven or competitive award process.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
