                               RESOLUTION


 
Recognizing Israeli-American culture and heritage and the contributions 
        of the Israeli-American community to the United States.

Whereas Israeli-Americans are a vibrant immigrant community contributing to the 
        diversity of the United States;
Whereas Israeli-Americans, including those on college campuses in the United 
        States, have been subject to forms of discrimination and desire to 
        connect with their culture and celebrate their heritage free from 
        bigotry and bias;
Whereas the United States is a nation of immigrants, and Israeli-Americans 
        contribute invaluable skills that promote the economy and protect the 
        national security of the United States;
Whereas the contributions of Israeli-Americans in the fields of astrophysics, 
        mathematics, chemistry, aerospace engineering, biotech, agriculture, and 
        Internet technologies have been invaluable to the United States;
Whereas Israeli-Americans have helped to form a strong bond between the people 
        of the United States and the people of Israel, reinforcing the shared 
        values and interests between the two countries; and
Whereas countless Israeli-Americans have enriched the society of the United 
        States: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) affirms that the Israeli-American community has 
        contributed immensely to the society and culture of the United 
        States; and
            (2) condemns all forms of discrimination that aim to 
        marginalize or disenfranchise members of the Israeli-American 
        community.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
