On or before:                             Action to be completed:
5 days before the President's budget      CBO Discretionary Sequestration Preview Report.

The President's budget submission.......  OMB Discretionary Sequestration Preview Report.
10 days after end of session............  CBO Final Discretionary Sequestration Report.

                                           Order.
 

    (b) Presidential Order.--
            (1) In general.--On the date specified in subsection (a), 
        if in its Final Sequestration Report, OMB estimates that any 
        sequestration is required, the President shall issue an order 
        fully implementing without change all sequestrations required 
        by the OMB calculations set forth in that report. This order 
        shall be effective on issuance.
            (2) Special rule.--If the date specified for the submission 
        of a Presidential order under subsection (a) falls on a Sunday 
        or legal holiday, such order shall be issued on the following 
        day.
    (c) Effects of Sequestration.--The effects of sequestration shall 
be as follows:

        activities within a budget account (with programs, projects, 
        and activities as delineated in the appropriation Act or 
        accompanying report for the relevant fiscal year covering that 
        account).
            (3) Administrative regulations or similar actions 
        implementing a sequestration shall be made within 120 days of 
        the sequestration order. To the extent that formula allocations 
        differ at different levels of budgetary resources within an 
        account, program, project, or activity, the sequestration shall 
        be interpreted as producing a lower total appropriation, with 
        the remaining amount of the appropriation being obligated in a 
        manner consistent with program allocation formulas in 
        substantive law.
            (4) Except as otherwise provided in this part, obligations 
        or budgetary resources in sequestered accounts shall be reduced 
        only in the fiscal year in which a sequester occurs.
            (5) Budgetary resources sequestered in special fund 
        accounts and offsetting collections sequestered in 
        appropriation accounts shall not be available for obligation 
        during the fiscal year in which the sequestration occurs, but 
        shall be available in subsequent years to the extent otherwise 
        provided in law.
    (d) Submission and Availability of Reports.--Each report required 
by this section shall be submitted, in the case of CBO, to the House of 
Representatives, the Senate, and OMB and, in the case of OMB, to the 
House of Representatives, the Senate, and the President on the day it 
is issued. On the following day a notice of the report shall be printed 
in the Federal Register.

        enacted through those dates.
            (2) Discretionary spending.--The Final Discretionary 
        Sequestration Reports shall set forth estimates for each of the 
        following:
                    (A) For the current year and each subsequent year

                resources for any budget account to be reduced if such 
                difference is greater than $5,000,000.
    (d) Economic and Technical Assumptions.--In all reports required by 
this section, OMB shall use the same economic and technical assumptions 
as used in the most recent budget submitted by the President under 
section 1105(a) of title 31, United States Code.

SEC. 222. LIMITS.

    (a) Discretionary Spending Limits.--As used in this title, the term 
``non-security discretionary spending limit'' shall have the same 
meaning as in section 316 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.
    (b) Enforcement.--
            (1) Sequestration.--On the date specified in section 
        212(a), there shall be a sequestration to eliminate a budget-
        year breach.
            (2) Eliminating a breach.--Each non-security discretionary 
        account shall be reduced by a dollar amount calculated by 
        multiplying the enacted level of budget authority for that year 
        in that account at that time by the uniform percentage 
        necessary to eliminate a breach of the discretionary spending 
        limit.
            (3) Part-year appropriations.--If, on the date the report 
        is issued under paragraph (1), there is in effect an Act making 
        continuing appropriations for part of a fiscal year for any 
        budget account, then the dollar sequestration calculated for 
        that account under paragraph (2) shall be subtracted from--
                    (A) the annualized amount otherwise available by 
                law in that account under that or a subsequent part-
                year appropriation; and
                    (B) when a full-year appropriation for that account 
                is enacted, from the amount otherwise provided by the 
                full-year appropriation.
            (4) Look-back.--If, after June 30, an appropriation for the 
        fiscal year in progress is enacted that causes a breach for 
        that year (after taking into account any previous 
        sequestration), the discretionary spending limit for the next 
        fiscal year shall be reduced by the amount of that breach.
            (5) Within-session sequestration reports and order.--If an 
        appropriation for a fiscal year in progress is enacted (after 
        Congress adjourns to end the session for that budget year and 
        before July 1 of that fiscal year) that causes a breach, 10 
        days later CBO shall issue a report containing the information 
        required in section 221(c). Fifteen days after enactment, OMB 
        shall issue a report containing the information required in 
        section 221(c). On the same day as the OMB report, the 
        President shall issue an order fully implementing without 
        change all sequestrations required by the OMB calculations set 
        forth in that report. This order shall be effective on 
        issuance.
    (c) Estimates.--
            (1) CBO estimates.--As soon as practicable after Congress 
        completes action on any legislation providing discretionary 
        appropriations, CBO shall provide an estimate to OMB of that 
        legislation.
            (2) OMB estimates.--Not later than 7 calendar days 
        (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays) after the 
        date of enactment of any discretionary appropriations, OMB 
        shall transmit a report to the Senate and to the House of 
        Representatives containing--
                    (A) the CBO estimate of that legislation;
                    (B) an OMB estimate of that legislation using 
                current economic and technical assumptions; and
                    (C) an explanation of any difference between the 2 
                estimates.
            (3) Differences.--If during the preparation of the report 
        under paragraph (2), OMB determines that there is a difference 
        between the OMB and CBO estimates, OMB shall consult with the 
        Committees on the Budget of the House of Representatives and 
        the Senate regarding that difference and that consultation, to 
        the extent practicable, shall include written communication to 
        such committees that affords such committees the opportunity to 
        comment before the issuance of that report.
            (4) Assumptions and guidelines.--OMB and CBO shall prepare 
        estimates under this paragraph in conformance with scorekeeping 
        guidelines determined after consultation among the House and 
        Senate Committees on the Budget, CBO, and OMB.
