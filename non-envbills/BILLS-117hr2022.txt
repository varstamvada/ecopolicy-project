    (a) Border Crossings.--Notwithstanding section 235(b)(1) of the 
Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1225(b)(1)), if an alien who 
is seeking asylum in the United States attempts to enter the United 
States from Canada or Mexico at a land port of entry without a valid 
visa or other appropriate entry document, the immigration officer who 
is inspecting the alien--
            (1) may not admit or parole the alien into the United 
        States; and
            (2) shall advise the alien to schedule an asylum hearing 
        with the most convenient United States embassy or consulate in 
        Canada or Mexico.
    (b) Credible Fear Screenings.--An alien described in subsection (a) 
may only be permitted to enter the United States to apply for asylum if 
an asylum officer stationed at a United States embassy or consulate--
            (1) has conducted an in-person or telephonic interview with 
        the alien; and
            (2) as a result of such interview, has concluded that the 
        alien--
                    (A)(i) has been persecuted in the alien's country 
                of nationality on account of the alien's race, 
                religion, nationality, membership in a particular 
                social group, or political opinion;
                    (ii) has a credible fear of persecution (as defined

                Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1225(b)(1)(B))) if the alien 
                returned to such country; or
                    (iii) would be subject to torture by a government 
                or public official acting under the color of law if the 
                alien returned to his or her country of nationality; 
                and
                    (B) is otherwise eligible for asylum under section 
                208(a) of that Act (8 U.S.C. 1158(a)).
