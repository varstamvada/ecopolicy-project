To amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to assure that immigrants 
   do not have to wait longer for an immigrant visa as a result of a 
    reclassification from family second preference to family first 
    preference because of the naturalization of a parent or spouse.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. PREVENTING IMMIGRANTS FROM WAITING LONGER FOR IMMIGRANT 
              VISAS AS A RESULT OF RECLASSIFICATION FROM FAMILY SECOND 
              PREFERENCE TO FAMILY FIRST PREFERENCE.

    (a) In General.--Section 203 of the Immigration and Nationality Act 
(8 U.S.C. 1153) is amended by adding at the end the following new 
subsection:
    ``(i) Assuring Immigrants Do not Have to Wait Longer for an 
Immigrant Visa as a Result of Reclassification From Family Second 
Preference to Family First Preference.--Notwithstanding any other 
provision of law, in the case of a petition that has been approved to 
accord preference status under subsection (a)(2)(A) may be deemed to 
provide continued entitlement to status under that subsection in the 
case of any alien petitioner who is subsequently naturalized as a 
United States citizen, if a visa is not immediately available to the 
beneficiary under subsection (a)(1).''.
    (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) takes 
effect on the date of the enactment of this Act and applies to 
petitions filed before, on, or after such date, without regard to when 
an alien petitioner was naturalized as a citizen of the United States.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
