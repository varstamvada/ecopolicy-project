    Section 403(a) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 
1974 (29 U.S.C. 1103(a)) is amended--
            (1) by redesignating paragraphs (1) and (2) as 
        subparagraphs (A) and (B), respectively;
            (2) by striking ``Except as'' and inserting ``(1) Except 
        as''; and
            (3) by adding at the end the following:
    ``(2)(A) The assets of a single-employer plan shall be held in 
trust by a joint board of trustees, which shall consist of 2 or more 
trustees representing on an equal basis the interests of the employer 
or employers maintaining the plan and the interests of the participants 
and their beneficiaries.
    ``(B)(i) Except as provided in clause (ii), in any case in which 
the plan is maintained pursuant to one or more collective bargaining 
agreements between one or more employee organizations and one or more 
employers, the trustees representing the interests of the participants 
and their beneficiaries shall be designated by such employee 
organizations.
    ``(ii) In any case in which clause (i) does not apply with respect 
to a single-employer plan because the plan is not described in clause 
(i), the trustee or trustees representing the interests of the 
participants and their beneficiaries shall consist of 1 or more 
participants under the plan elected to serve as such in accordance with 
this clause.
    ``(C) Not later than one year after the date of enactment of the 
Encouraging More Proxy voting by Organized Workers, Employees, and 
Retirement Savers Act, the Secretary shall issue rules with respect to 
the election of trustees and certification of the results of such 
elections under subparagraph (B)(ii). Such rules shall ensure that--
            ``(i) employee trustee elections are--
                    ``(I) fair and democratic and free from 
                interference by the employer, the employer's 
                fiduciaries, and the investment managers;
                    ``(II) designed to maximize participation by plan 
                participants and their beneficiaries and to be 
                convenient for participants, and their beneficiaries 
                when appropriate, to vote;
                    ``(III) use the latest technologies to meet the 
                objectives described in subclause (II);
                    ``(IV) provide for a secret ballot to be used by 
                the participants of the plan (or, in the case of a 
                deceased participant, by the beneficiary of such 
                participant); and
                    ``(V) provide one vote per participant, which, in 
                the event a participant is deceased, may be cast by the 
                deceased participant's beneficiary; and
            ``(ii) trustee vacancies are filled--
                    ``(I) by the election process, and not by 
                appointment; and
                    ``(II) not later than one month after the trustee 
                position is vacant.''.

                failure to undergo training and fulfill the obligation 
                to develop guidelines in accordance with paragraph (1) 
                shall be deemed to be a violation of fiduciary duties

                employee benefit plan is invested in securities issued 
                by an investment company registered under the 
                Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-1), or
