                   IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES

                             August 9, 2021

    Mr. Inhofe (for himself and Mr. Rounds) submitted the following 
  resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations

                               RESOLUTION


 
 Expressing support for the State of Israel joining the African Union 
                         under observer status.

Whereas the State of Israel enjoyed observer status in the predecessor 
        organization to the African Union known as the Organization of African 
        Unity until its dissolution in 2002;
Whereas the late Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi blocked Israel from obtaining 
        observer status at the African Union in 2002;
Whereas Israel, in the span of a few decades, has emerged as a developed nation 
        and therefore offers an example of a path to economic progress for 
        developing countries;
Whereas Israel has long been an active and valuable partner to many African 
        nations, cultivating numerous strong bilateral relationships across the 
        continent;
Whereas Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made a historic visit to Africa in 
        July 2016 and became the first leader outside of Africa to address the 
        Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) in June 2017;
Whereas many African leaders subsequently visited Israel, including those from 
        the Republic of Chad, the Kingdom of Eswatini, the Federal Democratic 
        Republic of Ethiopia, the Republic of Ghana, the Republic of Cote 
        d'Ivoire, the Republic of Kenya, the Republic of Rwanda, the Republic of 
        Sierra Leone, the Togolese Republic, and the Republic of Zambia;
Whereas the Abraham Accords paved the way for further normalization agreements 
        between Israel and other nations;
Whereas Israel has supported African nations through economic investments and 
        humanitarian assistance; and
Whereas, on July 22, 2021, the African Union announced that Israel will join the 
        African Union under observer status: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) encourages heightened cooperation between the State of 
        Israel and African nations, particularly in areas that are 
        significant in progress towards the implementation of the 
        Sustainable Development Goals, such as economic growth, 
        sustainable agriculture, and humanitarian development;
            (2) expects Israel's observer status in the African Union 
        will help enable such cooperation to develop between Israel and 
        the African Union;
            (3) commends the African Union for granting Israel observer 
        status in the African Union; and
            (4) thanks Felix Tshisekedi, the President of the 
        Democratic Republic of the Congo and Chair of the African 
        Union, for his leadership in strengthening Israel-African 
        relations by ensuring the recognition of Israel under observer 
        status occurred during his tenure as Chair of the African 
        Union.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
