SEC. 2. DETENTION AND REMOVAL OF ALIENS ORDERED REMOVED.

    (a) Strengthening Procedures Regarding Aliens Ordered Removed, 
Including Dangerous Aliens.--Section 241(a) (8 U.S.C. 1231(a)) is 
amended--
            (1) by striking ``Attorney General'' the first place it 
        appears, except for the first reference in clause (a)(4)(B)(i), 
        and inserting ``Secretary of Homeland Security'';
            (2) by striking ``Attorney General'' any other place it 
        appears and inserting ``Secretary'';
            (3) in paragraph (1)--
                    (A) in subparagraph (B), by amending clause (ii) to 
                read as follows:
    ``(ii) If a court, the Board of Immigration Appeals, or an 
immigration judge orders a stay of the removal of the alien, the 
expiration date of the stay of removal.'';
                    (B) by amending subparagraph (C) to read as 
                follows:
                    ``(C) Extension of detention for uncooperative 
                removable aliens.--The removal period shall be extended 
                beyond a period of 90 days and the alien may remain in 
                detention during such extended period if the alien 
                fails or refuses to--
                            ``(i) make all reasonable efforts to comply 
                        with the removal order; or
                            ``(ii) fully cooperate with the Secretary's 
                        efforts to establish the alien's identity and 
                        carry out the removal order, including failing 
                        to make timely application in good faith for 
                        travel or other documents necessary to the 
                        alien's departure, or conspiring or acting to 
                        prevent the alien's removal.''; and
                    (C) by adding at the end the following:
                    ``(D) Tolling of period.--If, at the time described 
                in subparagraph (B), the alien is not in the custody of 
                the Secretary under the authority of this Act, the 
                removal period shall not begin until the alien is taken 
                into such custody. If the Secretary lawfully transfers 
                custody of the alien during the removal period to 
                another Federal agency or to a State or local 
                government agency in connection with the official 
                duties of such agency, the removal period shall be 
                tolled, and shall recommence on the date on which the 
                alien is returned to the custody of the Secretary.'';
            (4) in paragraph (2), by adding at the end the following: 
        ``If a court, the Board of Immigration Appeals, or an 
        immigration judge orders a stay of removal of an alien who is 
        subject to an administrative final order of removal, the 
        Secretary, in the exercise of discretion, may detain the alien 
        during the pendency of such stay of removal.'';
            (5) in paragraph (3), by amending subparagraph (D) to read 
        as follows:
                    ``(D) to obey reasonable restrictions on the 
                alien's conduct or activities, or to perform 
                affirmative acts, that the Secretary prescribes for the 
                alien--
                            ``(i) to prevent the alien from absconding;

                            ``(iii) for other purposes related to the 
                        enforcement of the immigration laws.'';
            (6) in paragraph (6), by striking ``removal period and, if 
        released,'' and inserting ``removal period, in the discretion 
        of the Secretary, without any limitations other than those 
        specified in this section, until the alien is removed. If an 
        alien is released, the alien'';
            (7) by redesignating paragraph (7) as paragraph (10); and
            (8) by inserting after paragraph (6) the following:
            ``(7) Parole.--If an alien detained pursuant to paragraph 
        (6) is an applicant for admission, the Secretary of Homeland 
        Security, in the Secretary's discretion, may parole the alien 
        under section 212(d)(5) and may provide, notwithstanding 
        section 212(d)(5), that the alien shall not be returned to 
        custody unless either the alien violates the conditions of the 
        alien's parole or the alien's removal becomes reasonably 
        foreseeable, provided that in no circumstance shall such alien 
        be considered admitted.
            ``(8) Additional rules for detention of aliens.--The 
        following procedures shall apply to an alien detained under 
        this section:
                    ``(A) Detention review process for aliens who have 
                effected an entry and fully cooperate with removal.--
                The Secretary of Homeland Security shall establish an 
                administrative review process to determine whether an 
                alien described in subparagraph (B) should be detained 
                or released after the removal period in accordance with 
                this paragraph.

                        certification under subparagraph (E)(ii) every 
                        6 months, without limitation, after providing 
                        the alien with an opportunity to request 
                        reconsideration of the certification and to 
                        submit documents or other evidence in support 
                        of that request. If the Secretary does not 
                        renew such certification, the Secretary shall 
                        release the alien, pursuant to subparagraph

                        of detention under paragraph (E), the alien may 
                        seek review of that determination before the 
                        Attorney General. If the Attorney General 
                        concludes that the alien should be released, 
                        then the Secretary shall release the alien

                        level of the Assistant Secretary for 
                        Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

                        Attorney General, provide for a hearing to make

                Secretary may, in the Secretary's discretion, impose 
                conditions on release in accordance with the 
                regulations prescribed pursuant to paragraph (3).

                to a final removal order who has previously been 
                released from custody if--
