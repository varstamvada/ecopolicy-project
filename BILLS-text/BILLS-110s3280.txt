         TITLE II--OPENING AND PRESERVING ACCESS TO OIL AND GAS

                Subtitle A--Deep Ocean Energy Resources

SEC. 201. POLICY.

    It is the policy of the United States that--
            (1) the United States is blessed with abundant energy 
        resources on the outer Continental Shelf and has developed a 
        comprehensive framework of environmental laws (including 
        regulations) and fostered the development of state-of-the-art 
        technology that allows for the responsible development of those 
        resources for the benefit of the citizens of the United States;
            (2) adjacent States (as defined in section 2 of the Outer 
        Continental Shelf Lands Act (43 U.S.C. 1331)) are required to 
        commit significant resources in support of exploration, 
        development, and production activities for mineral resources on 
        the outer Continental Shelf, and it is fair and proper for a 
        portion of the receipts from the activities to be shared with 
        adjacent States and local coastal governments;
            (3) the existing laws governing the leasing and production 
        of the mineral resources of the outer Continental Shelf have--
                    (A) reduced the production of mineral resources;
                    (B) preempted adjacent States from being 
                sufficiently involved in the decisions regarding the 
                allowance of mineral resource development; and
                    (C) been harmful to the national interest;
            (4) the national interest is served by granting the 
        adjacent States more options relating to whether or not mineral 
        leasing should occur in the outer Continental Shelf within the 
        Adjacent Zones (as defined in section 2 of the Outer 
        Continental Shelf Lands Act (43 U.S.C. 1331)) of the adjacent 
        States;
            (5) it is not reasonably foreseeable that exploration of a 
        leased tract located more than 25 miles seaward of the 
        coastline, development and production of a natural gas 
        discovery located more than 25 miles seaward of the coastline, 
        or development and production of an oil discovery located more 
        than 50 miles seaward of the coastline will adversely affect 
        resources near the coastline;
            (6) transportation of oil from a leased tract might 
        reasonably be foreseen, under limited circumstances, to have 
        the potential to adversely affect resources near the coastline 
        if the oil is within 50 miles of the coastline, but the 
        potential to adversely affect those resources is likely no 
        greater, and probably less, than the potential impacts from 
        tanker transportation because tanker spills usually involve 
        large releases of oil over a brief period of time; and
            (7) among other bodies of inland waters, the Great Lakes, 
        Long Island Sound, Delaware Bay, Chesapeake Bay, Albemarle 
        Sound, San Francisco Bay, and Puget Sound are not part of the 
        outer Continental Shelf, and are not subject to leasing by the 
        Federal Government for the exploration, development, and 
        production of any mineral resources that might lie beneath 
        those bodies of water.

SEC. 202. DEFINITIONS UNDER THE SUBMERGED LANDS ACT.

    Section 2 of the Submerged Lands Act (43 U.S.C. 1301) is amended--
            (1) in subsection (a)(2), by striking ``three geographical 
        miles distant'' and all that follows through ``beyond three 
        geographical miles,'' and inserting ``12 nautical miles distant 
        from the coast line of the State;'';

SEC. 214. FEDERAL ENERGY NATURAL RESOURCES ENHANCEMENT.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) energy and minerals exploration, development, and 
        production on Federal onshore and offshore land (including 
        biobased fuel, natural gas, minerals, oil, geothermal, and 
        power from wind, waves, currents, and thermal energy) involves 
        significant outlays of funds by Federal and State wildlife, 
        fish, and natural resource management agencies for 
        environmental studies, planning, development, monitoring, and 
        management of wildlife, fish, air, water, and other natural 
        resources;
            (2) State wildlife, fish, and natural resource management 
        agencies are funded primarily through permit and license fees 
        paid to the States by the general public to hunt and fish, and 
        through Federal excise taxes on equipment used for those 
        activities;
            (3) funds generated from consumptive and recreational uses 
        of wildlife, fish, and other natural resources are inadequate 
        to address the natural resources related to energy and minerals 
        development on Federal onshore and offshore land;
            (4) funds made available to Federal agencies responsible 
        for managing Federal onshore and offshore land and Federal-
        trust wildlife and fish species and habitats are inadequate to 
        address the natural resources related to energy and minerals 
        development on Federal onshore and offshore land;
            (5) receipts derived from sales, bonus bids, and royalties 
        under the mineral leasing laws of the United States are paid to 
        the Treasury through the Minerals Management Service of the 
        Department of the Interior; and
            (6) none of the receipts derived from sales, bonus bids, 
        and royalties under the minerals leasing laws of the United 
        States are paid to Federal or State agencies to examine, 
        monitor, and manage wildlife, fish, air, water, and other 
        natural resources related to natural gas, oil, and mineral 
        exploration and development.
    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this section are--
            (1) to authorize expenditures for the monitoring and 
        management of wildlife and fish, and habitat, and air, water, 
        and other natural resources related to energy and minerals 
        development on Federal onshore and offshore land;
            (2) to authorize expenditures for each fiscal year to the 
        Secretary of the Interior and the States; and
            (3) to use funds made available under this section to 
        secure the necessary trained workforce or contractual services 
        to conduct environmental studies, planning, development, 
        monitoring, and post-development management of wildlife and 
        fish and habitat and air, water, and other natural resources 
        that may be related to biobased fuel, gas, mineral, oil, wind, 
        or other energy exploration, development, transportation, 
        transmission, and associated activities on Federal onshore and 
        offshore land, including--
                    (A) pertinent research, surveys, and environmental 
                analyses conducted to identify any impact on wildlife, 
                fish, air, water, and other natural resources from 
                energy and mineral exploration, development, 
                production, and transportation or transmission;
                    (B) projects to maintain, improve, or enhance 
                wildlife and fish populations and habitat or air, 
                water, or other natural resources, including activities 
                under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 
                1531 et seq.);
                    (C) research, surveys, environmental analyses, and 
                projects that assist in managing (including mitigating 
                onsite or offsite, or both) the impacts of energy and 
                mineral activities on wildlife, fish, air, water, and 
                other natural resources; and
                    (D) projects to teach young people to live off the 
                land.
    (c) Definitions.--In this section:

                activities to areas that will minimize impact on fish 
                and wildlife, fish and wildlife habitat, subsistence 
                resources, and the environment;
                    (D) the use of existing facilities, to the maximum 
                extent practicable; and
