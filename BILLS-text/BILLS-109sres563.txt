_______________________________________________________________________

                               RESOLUTION


 
Designating September 13, 2006, as ``National Celiac Disease Awareness 
                                 Day''.

Whereas celiac disease affects 2,200,000 people in the United States, including 
        1 in 133 healthy people;
Whereas celiac disease is an intolerance to gluten, a protein found in wheat, 
        rye, oats, and barley, as well as some medicines and vitamins;
Whereas exposure to gluten damages the villi of the small intestine, interfering 
        with the absorption of nutrients in food;
Whereas celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder and a malabsorption disease;
Whereas celiac disease is a genetic disease, with 1 in 22 people having a first-
        degree relative with celiac disease;
Whereas the average length of time it takes for a symptomatic person to be 
        diagnosed with celiac disease is 11 years;
Whereas celiac disease is often misdiagnosed and underdiagnosed due to the fact 
        that symptoms can be attributed to other conditions and many doctors are 
        not very knowledgeable about the disease;
Whereas, according to a study, 60 percent of children and 41 percent of adults 
        diagnosed with celiac disease were asymptomatic;
Whereas celiac disease is diagnosed through tests measuring the blood for 
        abnormally high levels of the antibodies of immunoglobulin A, anti-
        tissue transglutaminase, and IgA anti-endomysium antibodies;
Whereas celiac disease is treated by following a gluten-free diet;
Whereas damage to the small intestine leads to an increased risk for 
        malnutrition, anemia, lymphoma and adenocarcinoma, osteoporosis, 
        miscarriage and congenital malformation, and short stature;
Whereas celiac disease is linked to many autoimmune disorders, including thyroid 
        disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, type 1 diabetes, liver disease, 
        collagen vascular disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and Sjogren's syndrome;
Whereas the connection between celiac disease and diet was first established by 
        Dr. Samuel Gee, who was born on September 13, 1839; and
Whereas the Senate is an institution that can raise awareness in the general 
        public and the medical community of celiac disease: Now, therefore, be 
        it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates September 13, 2006, as ``National Celiac 
        Disease Awareness Day'';
            (2) recognizes that all people of the United States should 
        become more informed and aware of celiac disease;
            (3) calls upon the people of the United States to observe 
        the date with appropriate ceremonies and activities; and
            (4) respectfully requests the Secretary of the Senate to 
        transmit a copy of this resolution to the Celiac Sprue 
        Association, the American Celiac Society, the Celiac Disease 
        Foundation, the Gluten Intolerance Group of North America, and 
        the Oklahoma Celiac Support Group.
