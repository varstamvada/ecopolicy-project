      Commemorating the 50th Anniversary of the Interstate System.

Whereas, on June 29, 1956, President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed into law--

    (1) the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956 (Public Law 84-627; 70 Stat. 
374) to establish the 41,000-mile National System of Interstate and Defense 
Highways, later designated as the ``Dwight D. Eisenhower National System of 
Interstate and Defense Highways''; and

    (2) the Highway Revenue Act of 1956 (Public Law 84-627; 70 Stat. 387) 
to create the Highway Trust Fund;

Whereas, in 1990, the National System of Interstate and Defense Highways was 
        renamed the Dwight D. Eisenhower System of Interstate and Defense 
        Highways to recognize the role of President Eisenhower in the creation 
        of the Interstate Highway System;
Whereas that web of superhighways, now spanning a total of 46,876 miles 
        throughout the United States, has had a powerful and positive impact on 
        the lives of United States citizens;
Whereas the Interstate System has proven to be a vital tool for transporting 
        people and goods from 1 region to another speedily and safely;
Whereas the use of the Interstate System has helped the Nation facilitate 
        domestic and global trade, and has allowed the Nation to create 
        unprecedented economic expansion and opportunities for millions of 
        United States citizens;
Whereas the Interstate System has enabled diverse communities throughout the 
        United States to come closer together, and has allowed United States 
        citizens to remain connected to each other as well as to the larger 
        world;
Whereas the Interstate System has made it easier and more enjoyable for United 
        States citizens to travel to long-distance destinations and spend time 
        with family members and friends who live far away;
Whereas the Interstate System is a pivotal link in the national chain of defense 
        and emergency preparedness efforts;
Whereas the Interstate System remains 1 of the paramount assets of the United 
        States, as well as a symbol of human ingenuity and freedom; and
Whereas the anniversary of the Interstate System provides United States citizens 
        with an occasion to honor 1 of the largest public works achievements of 
        all time, and reflect on how the Nation can maintain the effectiveness 
        of the System in the years ahead: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) proclaims 2006 as the Golden Anniversary Year of the 
        Dwight D. Eisenhower National System of Interstate and Defense 
        Highways;
            (2) recognizes and celebrates the achievements of the 
        Federal Highway Administration, State departments of 
        transportation, and the highway construction industry of the 
        United States, including contractors, designers, engineers, 
        labor, materials producers, and equipment companies, for their 
        contributions to the quality of life of the citizens of the 
        United States; and
            (3) encourages citizens, communities, governmental 
        agencies, and other organizations to promote and participate in 
        celebratory and educational activities that mark this uniquely 
        important and historic milestone.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
