                paragraph (3), not later than 90 days after the date of 
                enactment of the Government Transparency and

                paragraph (2).
                    ``(B) Annual update.--Beginning 1 year after the 
                date on which the Secretary of the Treasury makes the 
                records available under subparagraph (A), and each year 
                thereafter, the Secretary of the Treasury shall make 
                all records of individual payments made under this 
                section during the previous year available to Congress 
                and the public in accordance with paragraph (2).

        paragraph (1), the Secretary of the Treasury shall ensure 
        that--
                    ``(A) the records are made available on a publicly

                        under which the payment was made;
                            ``(iii) the amount of the total payment to 
                        each entity; and

                        the specific amount of the damages, interest, 
                        and attorneys' fees.
            ``(3) Prohibition.--
                    ``(A) In general.--The Secretary of the Treasury 
                may not make a record of individual payment available 
                under this subsection if--
                            ``(i) the payment was not the result of any 
                        executive branch, Federal department, agency, 
                        or instrumentality statutory or regulatory 
                        approval or permit related case, court order, 
                        consent decree, or Federal department, agency, 
                        or instrumentality settlement; or
                            ``(ii) the disclosure of the information is 
                        otherwise prohibited by law or court order, or 
                        is not in the best interest of national 
                        security.
                    ``(B) Rationale.--For each record of individual 
                payment not disclosed under subparagraph (A), the 
                Secretary of the Treasury shall submit to Congress a 
                statement explaining the rationale for not disclosing 
                the record.''.
