        of his life;
Whereas Chuck Brown, who taught himself to play guitar, became a virtuoso 
        singer, songwriter, guitarist, and band leader;
Whereas Chuck Brown's go-go beat gave the District of Columbia a musical 
        identity of its own and reminds the Nation that the District of Columbia

        Ellington and Marvin Gaye;
Whereas Chuck Brown's musical catalog spans 22 studio albums over 3 decades;

Whereas Chuck Brown's go-go has been passed from generation to generation with 
        undiminished popularity;
Whereas Chuck Brown influenced jazz, rap, and go-go musicians, such as the bands 
        Trouble Funk, Rare Essence, and Experience Unlimited (also known as 
        ``E.U.'');
Whereas Chuck Brown was so committed to securing statehood and equal voting 
        rights for the residents of the District of Columbia that he played a 
        concert on a very hot, humid day on the United States Capitol Grounds in 
        2010;
Whereas the District of Columbia has named a street located near the historic, 
        modernized Howard Theatre for Chuck Brown;
Whereas the District of Columbia has named a park located at 2901 20th Street 
        NE, for Chuck Brown;

Whereas August 22, 2022, is Chuck Brown's birthday: Now, therefore, be it

designation of ``Chuck Brown Day'', and honors Chuck Brown's 
contributions to music and to the District of Columbia.
