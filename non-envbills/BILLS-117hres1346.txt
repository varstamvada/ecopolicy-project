    Expressing support for the designation of the week beginning on 
          September 11, 2022, as ``Celebrate Community Week''.

Whereas ``Celebrate Community'' is a weeklong initiative to promote joint 
        community service among members of Lions Clubs International, Rotary 
        International, Kiwanis International, and Optimist International, and 
        the purpose is to elevate the collective social impact of the 
        organizations and promote a spirit of worldwide volunteer collaboration;
Whereas, from September 11 through September 17, thousands of local area 
        Kiwanis, Lions, Optimist, and Rotary clubs will take part in service to 
        address the needs of their communities during their second annual 
        Celebrate Community initiative;
Whereas Kiwanis clubs change children's lives by conducting service projects in 
        their local communities focused on health and nutrition, education and 
        literacy, and youth development;
Whereas Kiwanis clubs conduct more than 152,000 service projects globally and 
        raise nearly $133,000,000 annually;
Whereas Lions clubs encourage service-minded individuals to serve their 
        communities without personal financial reward;
Whereas, since 1917, Lions 1,400,000 members have strengthened local communities 
        through hands-on service and humanitarian projects, focused on the 
        environment and addressing childhood cancer, hunger, diabetes, vision, 
        and other pressing humanitarian needs presenting some of the biggest 
        challenges facing humanity;
Whereas, carrying the motto ``Bringing Out the Best in Youth, in our 
        Communities, and in Ourselves'', Optimists conduct positive service 
        projects that reach more than 6,000,000 young people each year;
Whereas Optimists conduct 65,000 community service projects each year, spending 
        $78,000,000 in their communities and impacting over 6,000,000 youth;
Whereas Rotary's 1,400,000 members believe we have a shared responsibility to 
        take action on the world's most persistent issues with sustainable, 
        community-based solutions; and
Whereas 46,000 Rotary clubs invest hundreds of millions of dollars and countless 
        volunteer hours to provide clean water and sanitation, support 
        education, prevent and treat disease, save mothers and children, grow 
        local economies, promote peace, protect the environment, and end polio 
        worldwide: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports the designation of Celebrate Community Week;
            (2) recognizes Kiwanis International, Lions Clubs 
        International, Optimist International, and Rotary International 
        for promoting community service and humanitarian assistance;
            (3) encourages Kiwanis International, Lions Clubs 
        International, Optimist International, and Rotary International 
        to continue to emphasize the values of community service and 
        improving the community for all individuals, especially our 
        youth;
            (4) applauds Kiwanis International, Lions Clubs 
        International, Optimist International, and Rotary International 
        for instilling in young people the value of community service; 
        and
            (5) appreciates Kiwanis International, Lions Clubs 
        International, Optimist International, and Rotary International 
        for the work of their members to continue to strengthen our 
        communities through service.
