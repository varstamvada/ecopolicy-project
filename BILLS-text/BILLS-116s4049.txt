     It is the sense of Congress that to achieve the national policy of 
the United States to have available, as soon as practicable, not fewer 
than 355 battle force ships--
            (1) the Navy must be adequately resourced to increase the 
        size of the Navy in accordance with the national policy, which 
        includes the associated ships, aircraft, personnel, 
        sustainment, and munitions;
            (2) across fiscal years 2021 through 2025, the Navy should 
        start construction on not fewer than--
                    (A) 12 Arleigh Burke-class destroyers;
                    (B) 10 Virginia-class submarines;
                    (C) 2 Columbia-class submarines;
                    (D) 3 San Antonio-class amphibious ships;
                    (E) 1 LHA-class amphibious ship;
                    (F) 6 John Lewis-class fleet oilers; and
                    (G) 5 guided missile frigates;
            (3) new guided missile frigate construction should increase 
        to a rate of between two and four ships per year once design 
        maturity and construction readiness permit;
            (4) the Columbia-class submarine program should be funded 
        with additions to the Navy budget significantly above the 
        historical average, given the critical single national mission 
        that these vessels will perform and the high priority of the 
        shipbuilding budget for implementing the National Defense 
        Strategy;
            (5) stable shipbuilding rates of construction should be 
        maintained for each vessel class, utilizing multi-year or block 
        buy contract authorities when appropriate, until a deliberate 
        transition plan is identified; and
            (6) prototyping of potential new shipboard subsystems 
        should be accelerated to build knowledge systematically, and, 
        to the maximum extent practicable, shipbuilding prototyping 
        should occur at the subsystem-level in advance of ship design.

SEC. 1214. SENSE OF SENATE ON SPECIAL IMMIGRANT VISA PROGRAM FOR AFGHAN 
              ALLIES.

    It is the sense of the Senate that--
            (1) the special immigrant visa program for Afghan allies is 
        critical to the mission in Afghanistan and the long-term 
        interests of the United States;
            (2) maintaining a robust special immigrant visa program for 
        Afghan allies is necessary to support United States Government 
        personnel in Afghanistan who need translation, interpretation, 
        security, and other services;
            (3) Afghan allies routinely risk their lives to assist 
        United States military and diplomatic personnel;
            (4) honoring the commitments made to Afghan allies with 
        respect to the special immigrant visa program is essential to 
        ensuring--
                    (A) the continued service and safety of such 
                allies; and
                    (B) the willingness of other like-minded 
                individuals to provide similar services in any future 
                contingency;
            (5) the Afghan Allies Protection Act of 2009 (8 U.S.C. 1101 
        note) states that all Government-controlled processing of 
        applications for special immigrant visas under that Act 
        ``should be completed not later than 9 months after the date on 
        which an eligible alien submits all required materials to 
        complete an application for such visa'';
            (6) any backlog in processing special immigrant visa 
        applications should be addressed as quickly as possible so as 
        to honor the United States commitment to Afghan allies as soon 
        as possible;
            (7) failure to process such applications in an expeditious 
        manner puts lives at risk and jeopardizes a critical element of 
        support to United States operations in Afghanistan; and
            (8) to prevent harm to the operations of the United States 
        Government in Afghanistan, additional visas should be made 
        available to principal aliens who are eligible for special 
        immigrant status under that Act.

SEC. 1215. SENSE OF SENATE AND REPORT ON UNITED STATES PRESENCE IN 
              AFGHANISTAN.

    (a) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that--
            (1) the United States and our coalition partners have made 
        progress in the fight against al-Qaeda and ISIS in Afghanistan; 
        however, both groups--
                    (A) maintain an ability to operate in Afghanistan;
                    (B) seek to undermine stability in the region; and
                    (C) threaten the security of Afghanistan, the 
                United States, and the allies of the United States;
            (2) the South Asia strategy correctly emphasizes the 
        importance of a conditions-based United States presence in 
        Afghanistan; therefore, any decision to withdraw the Armed 
        Forces of the United States from Afghanistan should be done in 
        an orderly manner in response to conditions on the ground, and 
        in coordination with the Government of Afghanistan and United 
        States allies and partners in the Resolute Support mission, 
        rather than arbitrary timelines;
            (3) a precipitous withdrawal of the Armed Forces of the 
        United States and United States diplomatic and intelligence 
        personnel from Afghanistan without effective, countervailing 
        efforts to secure gains in Afghanistan may allow violent 
        extremist groups to regenerate, threatening the security of the 
        Afghan people and creating a security vacuum that could 
        destabilize the region and provide ample safe haven for 
        extremist groups seeking to conduct external attacks;

SEC. 1235. SENSE OF SENATE ON NORTH ATLANTIC TREATY ORGANIZATION 
              ENHANCED OPPORTUNITIES PARTNER STATUS FOR UKRAINE.

    It is the sense of the Senate that--
            (1) the United States should support the designation of 
        Ukraine as an enhanced opportunities partner as part of the 
        Partnership Interoperability Initiative of the North Atlantic 
        Treaty Organization;
            (2) the participation of Ukraine in the enhanced 
        opportunities partner program is in the shared security 
        interests of Ukraine, the United States, and the North Atlantic 
        Treaty Organization alliance;
            (3) the unique experience, capabilities, and technical 
        expertise of Ukraine, especially with respect to hybrid 
        warfare, cybersecurity, and foreign disinformation, would 
        enable Ukraine to make a positive contribution to the North 
        Atlantic Treaty Organization alliance through participation in 
        the enhanced opportunities partner program;
            (4) while not a replacement for North Atlantic Treaty 
        Organization membership, participation in the enhanced 
        opportunities partner program would have significant benefits 
        for the security of Ukraine, including--
                    (A) more regular consultations on security matters;
                    (B) enhanced access to interoperability programs

        Organization standards, remains essential for--
                    (A) a more effective defense of the sovereignty and 
                territorial integrity of Ukraine;
                    (B) allowing Ukraine to achieve its full potential 
                as a strategic partner of the United States; and

SEC. 1237. SENSE OF SENATE ON KOSOVO AND THE ROLE OF THE KOSOVO FORCE 
              OF THE NORTH ATLANTIC TREATY ORGANIZATION.

     It is the sense of the Senate that--
            (1) normalization of relations between Kosovo and Serbia is 
        in the interest of both countries and would enhance security 
        and stability in the Western Balkans;
            (2) the United States should continue to support the 
        diplomatic efforts of Kosovo and Serbia to reach a historic 
        agreement to normalize relations between the two countries;
            (3) mutual recognition should be a central element of 
        normalization of relations between Kosovo and Serbia;
            (4) both Kosovo and Serbia should refrain from actions that 
        would make an agreement more difficult to achieve;
            (5) the Kosovo Force of the North Atlantic Treaty 
        Organization continues to play an indispensable role in 
        maintaining security and stability, which are the essential 
        predicates for the success of the diplomatic efforts of Kosovo 
        and Serbia to achieve normalization of relations;
            (6) the participation of the United States Armed Forces in 
        the Kosovo Force is foundational to the credibility and success 
        of mission of the Kosovo Force;
            (7) with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies and 
        other European partners contributing over 80 percent of the 
        troops for the mission, the Kosovo Force represents a positive 
        example of burden sharing;
            (8) together with the allies and partners of the United 
        States, the United States should--
                    (A) maintain its commitment to the Kosovo Force; 
                and
                    (B) take all appropriate steps to ensure that the 
                Kosovo Force has the necessary personnel, capabilities, 
                and resources to perform its critical mission; and
            (9) the United States should continue to support the 
        gradual transition of the Kosovo Security Force to a multi-
        ethnic army for the Republic of Kosovo that is interoperable 
        with North Atlantic Treaty Organization members through an 
        inclusive and transparent process that--
                    (A) respects the rights and concerns of all 
                citizens of Kosovo;
                    (B) promotes regional security and stability; and
                    (C) supports the aspirations of Kosovo for eventual 
                full membership in the North Atlantic Treaty 
                Organization.

              FEDERATION AND RELATED ACTIVITIES OF THE DEPARTMENT OF

    It is the sense of the Senate that--
            (1) the 2018 National Defense Strategy affirms the re-
        emergence of long-term strategic competition with the Russian 
        Federation as a principal priority for the Department of 
        Defense that requires sustained investment due to the magnitude 
        of the threat posed to United States security, prosperity, and 
        alliances and partnerships;
            (2) given the continued military modernization of the 
        Russian Federation, including the development of long-range 
        strike systems and other advanced capabilities, the United 
        States should prioritize efforts within the North Atlantic 
        Treaty Organization to implement timely measures to ensure that 
        the deterrence and defense posture of the North Atlantic Treaty 
        Organization remains credible and effective;
            (3) the United States should reaffirm support for the open-
        door policy of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization;
            (4) to enhance deterrence against aggression by the Russian 
        Federation, the Department of Defense should--
                    (A) continue--
                            (i) to prioritize funding for the European

                        requirements of the Joint Force in Europe;
                            (ii) to increase pre-positioned stocks of

                        pursuing training opportunities at military 
                        locations such as Camp Mihail Kogalniceanu in 
                        Romania and Novo Selo Training Area in

                            (ii) the frequency, scale, and scope of 
                        North Atlantic Treaty Organization and other 
                        multilateral exercises in the Black Sea region, 
                        including with the participation of Ukraine and 
                        Georgia; and
                            (iii) presence and activities in the 
                        Arctic, including special operations training 
                        and naval operations and training;
                    (C) maintain robust naval presence at Souda Bay, 
                Greece, and pursue opportunities for increased United 
                States presence at other locations in Greece;

                Western Balkan countries to promote interoperability 
                with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and

                    (E) expand information sharing, improve planning 
                coordination, and increase the frequency, scale, and 
                scope of exercises with Sweden and Finland to deepen 
                interoperability; and
            (5) to counter Russian Federation activities short of armed 
        conflict, the Department of Defense should--
                    (A) integrate with United States interagency 
                efforts to employ all elements of national power to 
                counter Russian Federation hybrid warfare; and
                    (B) bolster the capabilities of allies and partners

SEC. 1257. TRAINING OF ALLY AND PARTNER AIR FORCES IN GUAM.

    (a) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that--
            (1) the memorandum of understanding agreed to by the United 
        States and the Republic of Singapore on December 6, 2019, to 
        establish a fighter jet training detachment in Guam should be 
        commended;
            (2) such agreement is a manifestation of the strong, 
        enduring, and forward-looking partnership of the United States 
        and the Republic of Singapore; and
            (3) the permanent establishment of a fighter detachment in 
        Guam will further enhance the interoperability of the air 
        forces of the United States and the Republic of Singapore and 
        provide training opportunities needed to maximize their 
        readiness.
    (b) Report.--Not later than one year after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense shall submit to the 
congressional defense committees a report assessing the merit and

SEC. 1258. STATEMENT OF POLICY AND SENSE OF SENATE ON THE TAIWAN 
              RELATIONS ACT.

    (a) Statement of Policy.--It is the policy of the United States--
            (1) that the Taiwan Relations Act (Public Law 96-8; 22 
        U.S.C. 3301 et seq.) and the ``Six Assurances'' provided by the 
        United States to Taiwan in July 1982 are the foundation for 
        United States-Taiwan relations;
            (2) that nothing in the Taiwan Relations Act (Public Law 
        96-8; 22 U.S.C. 3301 et seq.) constrains deepening, to the 
        extent possible, the extensive, close, and friendly relations 
        of the United States and Taiwan, including defense relations;
            (3) that the Taiwan Relations Act (Public Law 96-8; 22 
        U.S.C. 3301 et seq.) shall be implemented and executed in a 
        manner consistent with evolving political, security, and 
        economic dynamics and circumstances;
            (4) that, as set forth in the Taiwan Relations Act (Public 
        Law 96-8; 22 U.S.C. 3301 et seq.), the United States expects 
        the ``future of Taiwan will be determined by peaceful means,'' 
        and that ``any effort to determine the future of Taiwan by 
        other than peaceful means'' is ``a threat to the peace and 
        security of the Western Pacific area and of grave concern to 
        the United States'';
            (5) that the increasingly coercive and aggressive behavior 
        of the People's Republic of China towards Taiwan, including 
        growing military maneuvers targeting Taiwan, is contrary to the 
        expectation of the peaceful resolution of the future of Taiwan;
            (6) that, as set forth in the Taiwan Relations Act (Public 
        Law 96-8; 22 U.S.C. 3301 et seq.), the United States will 
        support the development of capable, ready, and modern defense 
        forces necessary for Taiwan to maintain a sufficient self-
        defense capability, including by--
                    (A) supporting acquisition by Taiwan of defense 
                articles and services through foreign military sales, 
                direct commercial sales, and industrial cooperation, 
                with an emphasis on capabilities that support the 
                asymmetric defense strategy of Taiwan, including 
                antiship, coastal defense, antiarmor, air defense, 
                undersea warfare, advanced command, control, 
                communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance, 
                and reconnaissance, and resilient command and control 
                capabilities;
                    (B) ensuring timely review of and response to 
                requests of Taiwan for defense articles and services;
                    (C) conducting practical training and military 
                exercises with Taiwan, including, as appropriate, the 
                Rim of the Pacific exercise, combined training at the 
                National Training Center at Fort Erwin, and bilateral 
                naval exercises and training;
                    (D) examining the potential for expanding 
                professional military education and technical training 
                opportunities in the United States for military 
                personnel of Taiwan;
                    (E) pursuing a strategy of military engagement with 
                Taiwan that fully integrates exchanges at the 
                strategic, policy, and functional levels;
                    (F) increasing exchanges between senior defense 
                officials and general officers of the United States and 
                Taiwan consistent with the Taiwan Travel Act (Public 
                Law 115-135; 132 Stat. 341), especially for the purpose 
                of enhancing cooperation on defense planning and 
                improving the interoperability of the military forces 
                of the United States and Taiwan;
                    (G) conducting military exchanges with Taiwan 
                specifically focused on improving the reserve force of 
                Taiwan; and
                    (H) expanding cooperation in military medicine and 
                humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, including 
                through the participation of medical vessels of Taiwan 
                in appropriate exercises with the United States; and
            (7) that, as set forth in the Taiwan Relations Act (Public 
        Law 96-8; 22 U.S.C. 3301 et seq.), the United States will 
        maintain the capacity ``to resist any resort to force or other 
        forms of coercion that would jeopardize the security, or the 
        social or economic system, of the people on Taiwan'', including 
        the capacity of the United States Armed Forces to deny a ``fait 
        accompli'' operation by the People's Republic of China to 
        rapidly seize control of Taiwan.
    (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that the 
Secretary of Defense should--
            (1) ensure that policy guidance to the Department of 
        Defense related to United States-Taiwan defense relations is 
        fully consistent with the statement of policy set forth in 
        subsection (a); and
            (2) issue new policy guidance required to carry out such 
        policy.

SEC. 1259. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON PORT CALLS IN TAIWAN WITH THE USNS

conduct port calls in Taiwan with the USNS Comfort and the USNS Mercy--
            (1) to continue the collaboration between the United States

                    (A) research and development of tests, vaccines, 
                and medicines; and
                    (B) donations of face masks;
            (2) to further improve the cooperation between the United 
        States and Taiwan on military medicine and humanitarian 
        assistance and disaster relief;
            (3) to allow United States personnel to benefit from the 
        expertise of Taiwanese personnel, in light of the successful 
        response of Taiwan to COVID-19; and
            (4) to continue the mission of the USNS Comfort and the 
        USNS Mercy, which have demonstrated the value of the Department 
        capacity to deploy maritime medical capabilities worldwide and 
        provide contingency capacity in the United States during 
        significant crises.

SEC. 1260. LIMITATION ON USE OF FUNDS TO REDUCE TOTAL NUMBER OF MEMBERS 
              OF THE ARMED FORCES SERVING ON ACTIVE DUTY WHO ARE 
              DEPLOYED TO THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA.

    None of the funds authorized to be appropriated by this Act may be 
obligated or expended to reduce the total number of members of the 
Armed Forces serving on active duty and deployed to the Republic of 
Korea to fewer than 28,500 such members of the Armed Forces until 90 
days after the date on which the Secretary of Defense certifies to the 
congressional defense committees that--
            (1) such a reduction--
                    (A) is in the national security interest of the 
                United States; and
                    (B) will not significantly undermine the security 
                of United States allies in the region; and
            (2) the Secretary has appropriately consulted with allies 
        of the United States, including the Republic of Korea and 
        Japan, regarding such a reduction.

SEC. 1261. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON CO-DEVELOPMENT WITH JAPAN OF A LONG-
              RANGE GROUND-BASED ANTI-SHIP CRUISE MISSILE SYSTEM.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the Department of Defense should prioritize 
        consultations with the Ministry of Defense of Japan to 
        determine whether a ground-based, long-range anti-ship cruise 
        missile system would meet shared defense requirements of the 
        United States and Japan; and
            (2) if it is determined that a ground-based, long-range 
        anti-ship cruise missile system would meet shared defense 
        requirements, the United States and Japan should consider co-
        development of such a system.

SEC. 1655. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON NUCLEAR COOPERATION BETWEEN THE 
              UNITED STATES AND THE UNITED KINGDOM.

    It is the sense of the Senate that--
            (1) the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) continues 
        to play an essential role in the national security of the 
        United States and the independent nuclear deterrents of other 
        NATO members, such as the United Kingdom, have helped 
        underwrite peace and security;
            (2) the nuclear programs of the United States and the 
        United Kingdom have enjoyed significant collaborative benefits 
        as a result of the cooperative relationship formalized in the 
        Agreement for Cooperation on the Uses of Atomic Energy for 
        Mutual Defense Purposes, signed at Washington July 3, 1958, and 
        entered into force August 4, 1958 (9 UST 1028), between the 
        United States and the United Kingdom (commonly referred to as 
        the ``Mutual Defense Agreement'');
            (3) the unique partnership between the United States and 
        the United Kingdom has enhanced sovereign military and 
        scientific capabilities, strengthened bilateral ties, and 
        shared costs, particularly on such programs as the Trident II 
        D-5 weapons system and the common missile compartment for the 
        future Dreadnought and Columbia classes of submarines;
            (4) additionally, the extension of the nuclear deterrence 
        commitments of the United Kingdom to members of the NATO 
        alliance strengthens collective security while reducing the 
        burden placed on United States nuclear forces to deter 
        potential adversaries and assure allies of the United States 
        and the United Kingdom;
            (5) as the international security environment deteriorates 
        and potential adversaries expand and enhance their nuclear 
        forces, the extended deterrence commitments of the United 
        Kingdom play an increasingly important role in supporting the 
        security interests of the United States and allies of the 
        United States and the United Kingdom;
            (6) it is in the national security interest of the United 
        States to support the United Kingdom with respect to the 
        decision of the Government of the United Kingdom to maintain 
        its nuclear deterrent until global security conditions warrant 
        its elimination;
            (7) as the United States must modernize its aging nuclear 
        forces to ensure its ability to continue to field a nuclear 
        deterrent that is safe, secure, and effective, the United 
        Kingdom faces a similar challenge;
            (8) bilateral cooperation on the parallel development of 
        the W93/Mk7 warhead of the United States and the replacement 
        warhead of the United Kingdom, as well as associated 
        components, will allow the United States and the United Kingdom 
        to responsibly address challenges within their legacy nuclear 
        forces in a cost-effective manner that--
                    (A) preserves independent, sovereign control;
                    (B) is consistent with each country's obligations 
                under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear 
                Weapons, done at Washington, London, and Moscow July 1, 
                1968 (21 UST 483) (commonly referred to as the 
                ``Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty''); and
                    (C) supports nonproliferation objectives; and
            (9) continued cooperation between the nuclear programs of 
        United States and the United Kingdom, including through the 
        W93/Mk7 program, is essential to ensuring that the NATO 
        alliance continues to be supported by credible nuclear forces 
        capable of preserving peace, preventing coercion, and deterring 
        aggression.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the nuclear and ballistic missile threats from rogue 
        nations are increasing; and
            (2) the Department of Defense should fully assess 
        development of an interim ground-based missile defense 
        capability while also pursuing the development of a next 
        generation interceptor capability.
    (b) Interim Ground-based Interceptor.--
            (1) Development.--Not later than 30 days after the date of 
        the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense, acting 
        through the Director of the Missile Defense Agency and in 
        coordination with the Under Secretary of Defense for 
        Acquisition and Sustainment, the Commander of the United States 
        Northern Command, and the Commander of the United States 
        Strategic Command, shall commence carrying out a program to 
        develop an interim ground-based interceptor capability that 
        will--
                    (A) use sound acquisition practices;
                    (B) address the majority of current and near- to 
                mid-term projected ballistic missile threats to the 
                United States homeland from rogue nations;
                    (C) at minimum, meet the proposed capabilities of 
                the Redesigned Kill Vehicle program;
                    (D) leverage existing kill vehicle and booster 
                technology; and
                    (E) appropriately balance interceptor performance 
                with schedule of delivery.
            (2) Deployment.--The Secretary of Defense, acting through 
        the Director of the Missile Defense Agency and in coordination 
        with the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and 
        Sustainment, the Commander of the United States Northern 
        Command, and the Commander of the United States Strategic 
        Command, shall--
                    (A) conduct rigorous flight testing of the interim 
                ground-based interceptor; and

            (3) Waiver authority.--(A) The Secretary of Defense may 
        waive the requirements under paragraphs (1) and (2) if the 
        Secretary certifies to the congressional defense committees 
        that--
                    (i) the technology development is not technically 
                feasible;
                    (ii) the interim capability development is not in 
                the national security interest of the United States; or
                    (iii) the next generation interceptor for the 
                ground-based midcourse defense system can deliver 
                capability before the program otherwise required by 
                this subsection.
            (B) If the Secretary chooses to waive the requirements 
        under paragraphs (1) and (2), the Secretary shall submit to the 
        congressional defense committees along with the certification 
        required by subparagraph (A) of this paragraph--

                decision;
                    (ii) an estimate of projected rogue nation threats 
                to the United States homeland that will not be defended 
                against until the fielding of the next generation 
                interceptor for the ground-based midcourse defense 
                system; and
                    (iii) an updated schedule for development and 
                deployment of the next generation interceptor.
            (C) The Secretary may not delegate the certification 
        described in subparagraphs (A) and (B) unless the Secretary is 
        recused, in which case the Secretary may delegate such 
        certification to the Deputy Secretary of Defense.
    (c) Capabilities and Criteria.--The Director shall ensure that the 
interim ground-based interceptor developed under subsection (c)(1) 
meets, at a minimum, the following capabilities and criteria:

        based interceptors of the ground-based midcourse defense 
        system.
            (8) Sound acquisition processes.

SEC. 3501. MARITIME ADMINISTRATION.

    Section 109 of title 49, United States Code, is amended to read as 
follows:
``Sec. 109. Maritime Administration
    ``(a) Organization and Mission.--The Maritime Administration is an 
administration in the Department of Transportation. The mission of the 
Maritime Administration is to foster, promote, and develop the merchant 
maritime industry of the United States.
    ``(b) Maritime Administrator.--The head of the Maritime 
Administration is the Maritime Administrator, who is appointed by the 
President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate. The 
Administrator shall report directly to the Secretary of Transportation 
and carry out the duties prescribed by the Secretary.
    ``(c) Deputy Maritime Administrator.--The Maritime Administration 
shall have a Deputy Maritime Administrator, who is appointed in the 
competitive service by the Secretary, after consultation with the 
Administrator. The Deputy Administrator shall carry out the duties 
prescribed by the Administrator. The Deputy Administrator shall be 
Acting Administrator during the absence or disability of the 
Administrator and, unless the Secretary designates another individual, 
during a vacancy in the office of Administrator.
    ``(d) Duties and Powers Vested in Secretary.--All duties and powers 
of the Maritime Administration are vested in the Secretary.
    ``(e) Regional Offices.--The Maritime Administration shall have 
regional offices for the Atlantic, Gulf, Great Lakes, and Pacific port

    ``(f) Interagency and Industry Relations.--The Secretary shall 
establish and maintain liaison with other agencies, and with

securing preference to vessels of the United States for the 
transportation of those commodities.
    ``(g) Detailing Officers From Armed Forces.--To assist the 
Secretary in carrying out duties and powers relating to the Maritime 
Administration, not more than five officers of the Armed Forces may be 
detailed to the Secretary at any one time, in addition to details 
authorized by any other law. During the period of a detail, the 
Secretary shall pay the officer an amount that, when added to the 
officer's pay and allowances as an officer in the Armed Forces, makes 
the officer's total pay and allowances equal to the amount that would 
be paid to an individual performing work the Secretary considers to be 
of similar importance, difficulty, and responsibility as that performed 
by the officer during the detail.
    ``(h) Contracts, Cooperative Agreements, and Audits.--
            ``(1) Contracts and cooperative agreements.--In the same 
        manner that a private corporation may make a contract within 
        the scope of its authority under its charter, the Secretary may 
        make contracts and cooperative agreements for the United States 
        Government and disburse amounts to--

            ``(2) Audits.--The financial transactions of the Secretary 
        under paragraph (1) shall be audited by the Comptroller 
        General. The Comptroller General shall allow credit for an 
        expenditure shown to be necessary because of the nature of the 
        business activities authorized by this section or subtitle V of 
        title 46. At least once a year, the Comptroller General shall 
        report to Congress any departure by the Secretary from this 
        section or subtitle V of title 46.
    ``(i) Grant Administrative Expenses.--Except as otherwise provided 
by law, the administrative and related expenses for the administration 
of any grant programs by the Maritime Administrator may not exceed 3 
percent.
    ``(j) Authorization of Appropriations.--

        subsection, there are authorized to be appropriated such 
        amounts as may be necessary to carry out the duties and powers
