                   IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES

                                 A BILL


 
To amend the Public Health Service Act to establish a grant program to 
 award grants to public institutions of higher education located in a 
                 covered State, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Medical Student Education 
Authorization Act of 2022''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Access to high quality primary care is associated with 
        improved health outcomes and lower health care costs.
            (2) Substantial disparities exist in the distribution of 
        primary care providers.
            (3) Shortages of health care providers affect Tribal, 
        rural, and medically underserved communities more than the 
        populations of more densely populated areas, resulting in such 
        communities experiencing significant health challenges and 
        disparities.
            (4) American Indian, Alaskan Natives, and Native Hawaiians 
        tend to have lower health status, lower life expectancy, and 
        disproportionate disease burden when compared to other 
        Americans.
            (5) Having training experiences in, living among, and being 
        a member of Tribal, rural, and medically underserved 
        communities increases cultural awareness and can influence 
        career choice for physicians to better serve such populations.
            (6) Research shows there is a relationship between the 
        characteristics of a physician and the eventual practice 
        location, including being part of an underrepresented minority 
        or growing up in a rural area.

SEC. 3. EDUCATION PROGRAM TO SUPPORT PRIMARY HEALTH SERVICE FOR 
              UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS.
