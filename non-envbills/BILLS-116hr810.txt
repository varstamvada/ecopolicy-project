   To block the implementation of certain presidential actions that 
 restrict individuals from certain countries from entering the United 
                                States.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that Executive Order 13780 and the presidential 
proclamation issued on September 24, 2017--
            (1) contravene the intent of Congress in enacting section 
        202(a)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 
        1152(a)(1)), which states, ``no person shall receive any 
        preference or priority or be discriminated against in the 
        issuance of an immigrant visa because of the person's race, 
        sex, nationality, place of birth, or place of residence''; and
            (2) violate the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment 
        to the United States Constitution and the equal protection 
        component of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to 
        the United States Constitution.

SEC. 2. PROHIBITION AGAINST USE OF FUNDS.

    No funds, resources, or fees made available to the Secretary of 
Homeland Security, or to any other official of a Federal agency by any 
Act of Congress for any fiscal year, may be used to implement or 
enforce--
            (1) Executive Order 13780, signed on March 6, 2017; or
            (2) Presidential Proclamation 9645, issued on September 24, 
        2017.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
