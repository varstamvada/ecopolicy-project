   To expand the authority of the Secretary of Homeland Security to 
  transport and remove aliens unlawfully present in the United States.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Illegal Alien Transport and Removal 
Act of 2005''.

SEC. 2. TRANSPORT AND REMOVAL OF ALIENS UNLAWFULLY PRESENT IN THE 
              UNITED STATES.

    (a) Transport.--
            (1) In general.--The Secretary of Homeland Security is 
        authorized to enter into contracts with private entities for 
        the purpose of providing secure domestic transport of aliens 
        who are apprehended at or along the international land or 
        maritime borders from the custody of the Border Patrol to 
        detention facilities and other locations as necessary.
            (2) Criteria for selection.--To enter into a contract under 
        paragraph (1), a private entity shall submit an application to 
        the Secretary at such time, in such manner, and containing such 
        information as the Secretary may require. The Secretary shall 
        select from such applications those entities which offer, in 
        the determination of the Secretary, the best combination of 
        quality, lowest cost, and security.
    (b) Removal.--Nothing in section 241(a)(1)(C) of the Immigration 
and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1231(a)(1)(C)) shall be construed as 
preventing the Secretary from removing an alien from the United States 
if the alien has failed or refused to make timely application in good 
faith for travel or other documents necessary to the alien's departure 
or conspires or acts to prevent the alien's removal subject to an order 
of removal.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
