_______________________________________________________________________

                               RESOLUTION


 
    Recognizing September 22nd, 2022, as the Order of the Sons and 
     Daughters of Italy in America, Colombo-Stella Lodge 1149 Day.

Whereas the Order of the Sons and Daughters of Italy in America is the first and 
        oldest Italian fraternal organization in the United States, established 
        in 1905;
Whereas Alfonso Cubicciotti, a member, who was also president of many Italian 
        organizations, immigrated west to start the first lodge in California;
Whereas Cubicciotti was known because he spoke against the Dillingham bill, 
        which called for Italian immigrants to pass a literacy test, be measured 
        for physical desirability, and any health restrictions or ``defects'' 
        that could force their return to Italy;
Whereas a charter was signed on September 22, 1922, for the first lodge in 
        California located in Fresno, the geographic center of California and 
        one of the richest agricultural zones in our Nation;
Whereas the Sons of Italy Colombo Lodge 1149's main purpose was to give Italians 
        a place to gather safely, to socialize and to help assimilate in the 
        United States;
Whereas they were also very involved in Italian-American causes and worked to 
        end bigotry and discrimination;
Whereas, when established in 1922, the Sons of Italy Colombo Lodge was a ``men's 
        only'' club;
Whereas the women's auxiliary, the Stella Lodge, was established in 1928 and 
        when the men served in the military during World War II, membership was 
        depleted, and the women helped to save the Colombo Lodge;
Whereas the two merged and became what is now known as Colombo-Stella Lodge 
        1149;
Whereas since its origin, the Lodge has donated to many nonprofit and charitable 
        business organizations including war relief, the restoration of the 
        Statue of Liberty, Ellis Island, earthquake relief, children's 
        orphanages, and Cooley's anemia; and
Whereas, on September 22, 2022, the Order of the Sons and Daughters of Italy in 
        America, Colombo-Stella Lodge 1149, will celebrate 100 years of service 
        to the Fresno community, remaining the first and oldest Italian 
        organization in California: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives supports the 
designation of a ``Sons and Daughters of Italy in America, Colombo-
Stella Lodge 1149 Day''.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
