                                 A BILL


 
      To expand access to health care services, including sexual, 
reproductive, and maternal health services, for immigrants by removing 
 legal and policy barriers to health insurance coverage, and for other 
                               purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Health Equity and Access under the 
Law for Immigrant Women and Families Act of 2019'' or as the ``HEAL for 
Immigrant Women and Families Act of 2019''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds as follows:
            (1) Health insurance coverage reduces harmful disparities 
        by alleviating cost barriers to and increasing utilization of 
        necessary health care services, especially among low-income and 
        underserved populations, including women.
            (2) Based solely on their immigration status, many 
        immigrants and their families face legal and policy 
        restrictions on their ability to obtain affordable health 
        insurance coverage through Medicaid, the Children's Health 
        Insurance Program (CHIP), and the health insurance exchanges.
            (3) Lack of health insurance coverage contributes to 
        persistent disparities in the prevention, diagnosis, and 
        treatment of negative health outcomes experienced by immigrants 
        and their families.
            (4) Nearly half of immigrant women are of reproductive age. 
        Immigrant women are also disproportionately living in low-
        income households and lacking health insurance coverage. Legal 
        and policy barriers to affordable health insurance coverage 
        therefore particularly exacerbate their risk of negative 
        sexual, reproductive, and maternal health outcomes, with 
        lasting health and economic consequences for immigrant women, 
        their families, and society as a whole.
            (5) Denying health insurance coverage or imposing waiting 
        periods for health insurance coverage unfairly hinders the 
        ability of immigrants to attain good health and undermines the 
        economic well-being of their families.
            (6) The population of immigrant families in the United 
        States is expected to continue to grow. One in seven United 
        States residents is foreign-born, and approximately one in four 
        children in the United States has at least one immigrant 
        parent. It is therefore in the Nation's shared public health 
        and economic interest to remove legal and policy barriers to 
        affordable health insurance coverage based on immigration 
        status.
            (7) Although Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) 
        recipients are authorized to live and work in the United 
        States, they have been unfairly excluded from the definition of 
        lawfully present and lawfully residing for purposes of health 
        insurance coverage through the Department of Health and Human 
        Services, including Medicaid and CHIP, and the health insurance 
        exchanges.
            (8) Immigration law is constantly evolving and new 
        immigration categories for individuals with federally 
        authorized presence in the United States may be created.
    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to--
            (1) ensure that all individuals who are lawfully present in 
        the United States are eligible for all federally funded health 
        care programs; and
            (2) advance the ability of undocumented individuals to 
        obtain health insurance coverage through the health insurance 
        exchanges.

SEC. 3. REMOVING BARRIERS TO HEALTH COVERAGE FOR LAWFULLY PRESENT 
              INDIVIDUALS.

    (a) Medicaid.--Section 1903(v)(4) of the Social Security Act (42 
U.S.C. 1396b(v)(4)) is amended--
            (1) by amending subparagraph (A) to read as follows:
    ``(A) Notwithstanding sections 401(a), 402(b), 403, and 421 of the 
Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 
1996, payment shall be made under this section for care and services 
that are furnished to individuals who are not citizens of the United 
States, including aliens described in paragraph (1), if they otherwise 
meet the eligibility requirements for medical assistance under the 
State plan approved under this title (other than the requirement of the 
receipt of aid or assistance under title IV, supplemental security 
income benefits under title XVI, or a State supplementary payment) and 
are lawfully present in the United States (including such an individual 
who is granted deferred action or other federally authorized 
presence).'';
            (2) in subparagraph (B)--
                    (A) by striking ``a State that has elected to 
                provide medical assistance to a category of aliens 
                under subparagraph (A)'' and inserting ``individuals 
                provided medical assistance pursuant to subparagraph 
                (A)''; and
                    (B) by striking ``such an alien on the basis of 
                provision of assistance to such category'' and 
                inserting ``such an individual on the basis of 
                provision of assistance to such individual''; and
            (3) in subparagraph (C)--
                    (A) by striking ``an election by the State under 
                subparagraph (A)'' and inserting ``the application of 
                subparagraph (A)'';
                    (B) by inserting ``or be lawfully present'' after 
                ``lawfully reside''; and
                    (C) by inserting ``or present'' after ``lawfully 
                residing'' each place it appears.
    (b) CHIP.--Subparagraph (N) of section 2107(e)(1) of the Social 
Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1397gg(e)(1)) is amended to read as follows:
                    ``(N) Paragraph (4) of section 1903(v) (relating to 
                lawfully present individuals).''.
    (c) Effective Date.--
            (1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph (2), the 
        amendments made by this section shall take effect on the date 
        of enactment of this Act and shall apply to services furnished 
        on or after the date that is 90 days after such date of 
        enactment.
            (2) Exception if state legislation required.--In the case 
        of a State plan for medical assistance under title XIX, or a 
        State child health plan under title XXI, of the Social Security 
        Act which the Secretary of Health and Human Services determines 
        requires State legislation (other than legislation 
        appropriating funds) in order for the plan to meet the 
        additional requirements imposed by the amendments made by this 
        section, the respective State plan shall not be regarded as 
        failing to comply with the requirements of such title solely on 
        the basis of its failure to meet these additional requirements 
        before the first day of the first calendar quarter beginning 
        after the close of the first regular session of the State 
        legislature that begins after the date of enactment of this 
        Act. For purposes of the previous sentence, in the case of a 
        State that has a 2-year legislative session, each year of such 
        session shall be deemed to be a separate regular session of the 
        State legislature.
