                               RESOLUTION


 
  Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that the House 
should recognize Robert Aitken's Bible as a historical document of the 
                        United States Congress.

Whereas Robert Aitken's Bible is the first known English-language Bible to be 
        printed in North America;
Whereas, on January 21, 1781, Robert Aitken presented a memorial petition to 
        Congress offering to print an edition of the Holy Scriptures to be used 
        in schools;
Whereas, on September 12, 1782, the Committee on Congress issued a resolution 
        which approved the ``pious and laudable undertaking of Mr. Aitken, as 
        subservient to the interest of religion, as well as an instance of the 
        progress of arts in this country'', and recommended this edition of the 
        Bible to the inhabitants of the United States; and
Whereas Charles Thomson, the Secretary of the Continental Congress, signed the 
        resolution of the Aitken Bible issued on September 12, 1782: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Representatives that 
the House should recognize Robert Aitken's Bible as a historical 
document of the United States Congress.
