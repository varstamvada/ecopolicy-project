 Recognizing the significance of National Caribbean American Heritage 
                                 Month.

Whereas people of Caribbean heritage are found in every State of the Union;
Whereas emigration from the Caribbean to the American colonies began as early as 
        1619 with the arrival of indentured workers in Jamestown, Virginia;
Whereas, during the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries, a significant number of 
        slaves from the Caribbean were brought to the United States;
Whereas millions of people have emigrated from the Caribbean to the United 
        States;
Whereas the current population of people in the United States who were born in 
        or have ancestry from the Caribbean is estimated at over 8,500,000;
Whereas, like the United States, the countries of the Caribbean faced obstacles 
        of slavery and colonialism and struggled for independence;
Whereas, also like the United States, the people of the Caribbean have diverse 
        racial, ethnic, cultural, and religious backgrounds;
Whereas independence movements throughout the Caribbean and the consequential 
        establishment of independent democratic countries in the Caribbean 
        strengthened ties between the Caribbean and the United States;
Whereas Alexander Hamilton, a Founding Father of the United States and the first 
        Secretary of the Treasury, was born in the Caribbean;
Whereas many influential Caribbean Americans have contributed to the rich 
        history of the United States, including Jean Baptiste Pointe du Sable, 
        the pioneer settler of Chicago; Claude McKay, a poet of the Harlem 
        Renaissance; James Weldon Johnson, the writer of the Black National 
        Anthem; Celia Cruz, the world-renowned queen of Salsa music; Sylvia 
        Winter, influential feminist, writer, and human rights activist; Cicely 
        Tyson, legendary star of stage and screen; John Russworm, co-founder of 
        Freedom's Journal, the first Black-owned newspaper; Mervyn Dymally, the 
        first African-American Lieutenant Governor of California and first 
        Caribbean immigrant to serve in Congress, and Shirley Chisholm, the 
        first African-American Congresswoman and first African-American woman 
        candidate for President;
Whereas the many influential Caribbean Americans in the history of the United 
        States also include Kamala Harris, the first African-American Vice 
        President; Colin Powell, the first African-American Secretary of State; 
        Eric Holder, the first African-American Attorney General; Karine Jean-
        Pierre, the first African-American White House Press Secretary; Patrick 
        Gaspard, labor union organizer and social justice advocate; Lieutenant 
        General Vincent Stewart, the first Black director of the Defense 
        Intelligence Agency; Sandra Lindsay, a nurse in Queens, New York and the 
        first person in the United States to receive a COVID-19 vaccine; Robert 
        Rashford, an internationally known aerospace engineer and coinventor of 
        the single person spacecraft; Harry Belafonte, a legendary musician, 
        actor, and activist; and Sir Sydney Poitier, the first Black actor to 
        win the Academy Award for Best Actor, film director, and diplomat;
Whereas Caribbean Americans have played an active role in the civil rights 
        movement and other social and political movements in the United States;
Whereas Caribbean Americans have contributed to every aspect of our society, 
        including greatly to the fine arts, education, business, literature, 
        journalism, sports, fashion, politics, government, the military, music, 
        science, medicine, engineering, technology, and other fields in the 
        United States;
Whereas Caribbean Americans share their culture through festivals, carnivals, 
        music, dance, film, food, and literature, which enrich the cultural 
        landscape of the United States;
Whereas the countries of the Caribbean are important economic partners of the 
        United States;
Whereas the members of the Caribbean diaspora contribute to prosperity in the 
        United States and the sustainable economic development of the Caribbean, 
        and for 30 years the Institute of Caribbean Studies has encouraged the 
        community's civic engagement through research, advocacy, education, and 
        action;
Whereas the countries of the Caribbean represent the United States third border;
Whereas the people of the Caribbean share the hopes and aspirations of the 
        people of the United States for peace and prosperity throughout the 
        Western Hemisphere and the rest of the world; and
Whereas, since the passage of H. Con. Res. 71 in the 109th Congress by both the 
        Senate and the House of Representatives, a proclamation has been issued 
        annually by the President declaring June National Caribbean American 
        Heritage Month: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports the goals and ideals of Caribbean American 
        Heritage Month;
            (2) encourages the people of the United States to observe 
        Caribbean American Heritage Month with appropriate ceremonies, 
        celebrations, and activities; and
            (3) affirms that--
                    (A) the contributions of Caribbean Americans are a 
                significant part of the history, progress, and heritage 
                of the United States; and
                    (B) the ethnic and racial diversity of the United 
                States enriches and strengthens the Nation.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
