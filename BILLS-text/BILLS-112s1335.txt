                      in a proceeding relating to an investigation

        Administrator carries out unless the Board finds an 
        interpretation is arbitrary, capricious, or otherwise not 
        according to law''.

        interpretation is arbitrary, capricious, or otherwise not 
        according to law''.

    (d) Appeal From Certificate Actions.--
            (1) In general.--Upon a decision by the National 
        Transportation Safety Board upholding an order or a final 
        decision by the Administrator denying an airman certificate 
        under section 44703(d) of title 49, United States Code, or 
        imposing a punitive civil action or an emergency order of 
        revocation under subsections (d) and (e) of section 44709 of 
        such title, an individual substantially affected by an order of 
        the Board may, at the individual's election, file an appeal in 
        the United States district court in which the individual resides 
        or in which the action in question occurred, or in the United 
        States District Court for the District of Columbia. If the 
        individual substantially affected by an order of the Board 
        elects not to file an appeal in a United States district court, 
        the individual may file an appeal in an appropriate United 
        States court of appeals.
            (2) Emergency order pending judicial review.--Subsequent to 
        a decision by the Board to uphold an Administrator's emergency 
        order under section 44709(e)(2) of title 49, United States Code, 
        and absent a stay of the enforcement of that order by the Board, 
        the emergency order of amendment, modification, suspension, or 
        revocation of a certificate shall remain in effect, pending the 
        exhaustion of an appeal to a Federal district court as provided 
        in this Act.

    (e) Standard of Review.--
            (1) In general.--In an appeal filed under subsection (d) in 
        a United States district court, the district court shall give 
        full independent review of a denial, suspension, or revocation 
        ordered by the Administrator, including substantive independent 
        and expedited review of any decision by the Administrator to 
        make such order effective immediately.
            (2) Evidence.--A United States district court's review under 
        paragraph (1) shall include in evidence any record of the 
        proceeding before the Administrator and any record of the 
        proceeding before the National Transportation Safety

[[Page 126 STAT. 1162]]

        Board, including hearing testimony, transcripts, exhibits, 
        decisions, and briefs submitted by the parties.
SEC. 3. &lt;&lt;NOTE: 49 USC 44701 note.&gt;&gt;  NOTICES TO AIRMEN.

    (a) In General.--
            (1) Definition.--In this section, the term ``NOTAM'' means 
        Notices to Airmen.
            (2) &lt;&lt;NOTE: Deadline.&gt;&gt;  Improvements.--Not later than 180 
        days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the 
        Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration shall begin 
        a Notice to Airmen Improvement Program (in this section referred 
        to as the ``NOTAM Improvement Program'')--
                    (A) to improve the system of providing airmen with 
                pertinent and timely information regarding the national 
                airspace system;
                    (B) to archive, in a public central location, all 
                NOTAMs, including the original content and form of the 
                notices, the original date of publication, and any 
                amendments to such notices with the date of each 
                amendment; and
                    (C) to apply filters so that pilots can prioritize 
                critical flight safety information from other airspace 
                system information.

    (b) Goals of Program.--The goals of the NOTAM Improvement Program 
are--
            (1) to decrease the overwhelming volume of NOTAMs an airman 
        receives when retrieving airman information prior to a flight in 
        the national airspace system;
            (2) make the NOTAMs more specific and relevant to the 
        airman's route and in a format that is more useable to the 
        airman;
            (3) to provide a full set of NOTAM results in addition to 
        specific information requested by airmen;
            (4) to provide a document that is easily searchable; and
            (5) to provide a filtering mechanism similar to that 
        provided by the Department of Defense Notices to Airmen.

    (c) &lt;&lt;NOTE: Establishment.&gt;&gt;  Advice From Private Sector Groups.--
The Administrator shall establish a NOTAM Improvement Panel, which shall 
be comprised of representatives of relevant nonprofit and not-for-profit 
general aviation pilot groups, to advise the Administrator in carrying 
out the goals of the NOTAM Improvement Program under this section.

    (d) &lt;&lt;NOTE: Deadline.&gt;&gt;  Phase-in and Completion.--The improvements 
required by this section shall be phased in as quickly as practicable 
and shall be completed not later than the date that is 1 year after the 
date of the enactment of this Act.

    (a) Assessment.--
            (1) &lt;&lt;NOTE: Deadline.&gt;&gt;  In general.--Not later than 180 
        days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the 
        Comptroller General of the United States shall initiate an 
        assessment of the Federal Aviation Administration's medical 
        certification process and the associated medical standards and 
        forms.
            (2) Report.--The Comptroller General shall submit a report 
        to Congress based on the assessment required under paragraph (1) 
        that examines--
                    (A) revisions to the medical application form that 
                would provide greater clarity and guidance to 
                applicants;

[[Page 126 STAT. 1163]]

                    (B) the alignment of medical qualification policies 
                with present-day qualified medical judgment and 
                practices, as applied to an individual's medically 
                relevant circumstances; and
                    (C) steps that could be taken to promote the 
                public's understanding of the medical requirements that 
                determine an airman's medical certificate eligibility.

    (b) Goals of the Federal Aviation Administration's Medical 
Certification Process.--The goals of the Federal Aviation 
Administration's medical certification process are--
            (1) to provide questions in the medical application form 
        that--
                    (A) are appropriate without being overly broad;
                    (B) are subject to a minimum amount of 
                misinterpretation and mistaken responses;
                    (C) allow for consistent treatment and responses 
                during the medical application process; and
                    (D) avoid unnecessary allegations that an individual 
                has intentionally falsified answers on the form;
            (2) to provide questions that elicit information that is 
        relevant to making a determination of an individual's medical 
        qualifications within the standards identified in the 
        Administrator's regulations;
            (3) to give medical standards greater meaning by ensuring 
        the information requested aligns with present-day medical 
        judgment and practices; and
            (4) to ensure that--
                    (A) the application of such medical standards 
                provides an appropriate and fair evaluation of an 
                individual's qualifications; and
                    (B) the individual understands the basis for 
                determining medical qualifications.

    (c) &lt;&lt;NOTE: Establishment.&gt;&gt;  Advice From Private Sector Groups.--
The Administrator shall establish a panel, which shall be comprised of 
representatives of relevant nonprofit and not-for-profit general 
aviation pilot groups, aviation medical examiners, and other qualified 
medical experts, to advise the Administrator in carrying out the goals 
of the assessment required under this section.

    (d) &lt;&lt;NOTE: Deadline.&gt;&gt;  Federal Aviation Administration Response.--
Not later than 1 year after the issuance of the report by the 
Comptroller

[[Page 126 STAT. 1164]]

General pursuant to subsection (a)(2), the Administrator shall take 
appropriate actions to respond to such report.

    Approved August 3, 2012.
