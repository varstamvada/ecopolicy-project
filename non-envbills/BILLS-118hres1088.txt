                               RESOLUTION


 
   Designating ``National Zoroastrian Day'' on the day of the vernal 
                         equinox of each year.

Whereas Zoroastrianism is regarded as one of the world's oldest monotheistic 
        religions, originating in ancient Persia;
Whereas the Zoroastrian legacy includes contributions to history, civilization, 
        and influencing the development of world democracy by upholding 
        universal human rights;
Whereas Zoroastrians developed a blueprint for governing a multicultural society 
        focused on recognition of diversity;
Whereas Zoroastrians were among the first to exercise legal concepts with 
        respect for the law, such as representation by an attorney, arbitration, 
        and execution of wills;
Whereas Cyrus the Great, a follower of Zoroastrianism, recorded the first 
        declaration of human rights on the Cyrus Cylinder in 539 B.C.E.;
Whereas the Zoroastrian declaration of human rights, focusing on freedom of 
        religion, cultural and civil rights, and abolishment of slavery, 
        influenced the American Founding Fathers and the United States 
        Constitution;
Whereas Zoroastrianism has an estimated 100,000 to 200,000 worshipers worldwide, 
        with over 14,000 Zoroastrians residing in the United States of America;
Whereas the spring festival of Nowruz, also referred to as ``Navrus'' or 
        ``Novruz'', which celebrates the new year, is held on the day of the 
        vernal equinox, and is the most auspicious day in the Zoroastrian 
        calendar; and
Whereas the festival is rooted in celebrating the triumph of light over 
        darkness: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives supports the 
designation of ``National Zoroastrian Day''.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
