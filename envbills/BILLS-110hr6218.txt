    (c) Terms and Conditions.--
            (1) In general.--The Secretary shall make guarantees under

        distribution to a variety of borrowers.

                        promulgated by the Secretary and specified in 
                        the guarantee contract), the holder of the

                            (ii) Payment required.--Within such period 
                        as may be specified in the guarantee or related 
                        agreements, the Secretary shall pay to the 
                        holder of the guarantee the unpaid interest on, 
                        and unpaid principal of the obligation as to 
                        which the borrower has defaulted, unless the 
                        Secretary finds that there was no default by 
                        the borrower in the payment of interest or 
                        principal or that the default has been 
                        remedied.
                            (iii) Forbearance.--Nothing in this 
                        paragraph precludes any forbearance by the 
                        holder of the obligation for the benefit of the 
                        borrower which may be agreed upon by the 
                        parties to the obligation and approved by the 
                        Secretary.

                            (i) In general.--If the Secretary makes a 
                        payment under subparagraph (A), the Secretary 
                        shall be subrogated to the rights of the 
                        recipient of the payment as specified in the 
                        guarantee or related agreements including, 
                        where appropriate, the authority 
                        (notwithstanding any other provision of law) 
                        to--
                                    (I) complete, maintain, operate, 
                                lease, or otherwise dispose of any 
                                property acquired pursuant to such 
                                guarantee or related agreements; or

                                to an agreement with the Secretary, to 
                                continue to pursue the purposes of the 
                                project if the Secretary determines 
                                this to be in the public interest.
                            (ii) Superiority of rights.--The rights of 
                        the Secretary, with respect to any property 
                        acquired pursuant to a guarantee or related 
                        agreements, shall be superior to the rights of 
                        any other person with respect to the property.
                            (iii) Terms and conditions.--A guarantee 
                        agreement shall include such detailed terms and 
                        conditions as the Secretary determines 
                        appropriate to--
                                    (I) protect the interests of the 
                                United States in the case of default; 
                                and
                                    (II) have available all the patents 
                                and technology necessary for any person 
                                selected, including the Secretary, to 
                                complete and operate the project.
                    (C) Payment of principal and interest by 
                secretary.--With respect to any obligation guaranteed 
                under this section, the Secretary may enter into a 
                contract to pay, and pay, holders of the obligation, 
                for and on behalf of the borrower, from funds 
                appropriated for that purpose, the principal and 
                interest payments which become due and payable on the 
                unpaid balance of the obligation if the Secretary finds 
                that--
                            (i)(I) the borrower is unable to meet the 
                        payments and is not in default;
                            (II) it is in the public interest to permit 
                        the borrower to continue to pursue the purposes 
                        of the project; and
                            (III) the probable net benefit to the 
                        Federal Government in paying the principal and 
                        interest will be greater than that which would 
                        result in the event of a default;
                            (ii) the amount of the payment that the 
                        Secretary is authorized to pay shall be no 
                        greater than the amount of principal and 
                        interest that the borrower is obligated to pay 
                        under the agreement being guaranteed; and
                            (iii) the borrower agrees to reimburse the 
                        Secretary for the payment (including interest) 
                        on terms and conditions that are satisfactory 
                        to the Secretary.
                    (D) Action by attorney general.--
                            (i) Notification.--If the borrower defaults 
                        on an obligation, the Secretary shall notify 
                        the Attorney General of the default.
                            (ii) Recovery.--On notification, the 
                        Attorney General shall take such action as is 
                        appropriate to recover the unpaid principal and 
                        interest due from--
                                    (I) such assets of the defaulting 
                                borrower as are associated with the 
                                obligation; or
                                    (II) any other security pledged to 
                                secure the obligation.
            (9) Fees.--

                administrative expenses.
                    (B) Availability.--Fees collected under this 
                paragraph shall--
                            (i) be deposited by the Secretary into the 
                        Treasury; and
                            (ii) remain available until expended, 
                        subject to such other conditions as are 
                        contained in annual appropriations Acts.
            (10) Records; audits.--
                    (A) In general.--A recipient of a guarantee shall 
                keep such records and other pertinent documents as the

                records as the Secretary may require to facilitate an 
                effective audit.
                    (B) Access.--The Secretary and the Comptroller 
                General of the United States, or their duly authorized

            (11) Full faith and credit.--The full faith and credit of 
        the United States is pledged to the payment of all guarantees
