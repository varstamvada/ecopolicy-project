    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The Department of Health and Human Services, under 
        Federal law as in effect on the date of the enactment of this 
        Act, is responsible for the care of each unaccompanied alien 
        child in the United States, including any such child placed 
        with a sponsor, until the earlier of--
                    (A) the date on which the immigration proceedings 
                of the child are concluded; or
                    (B) the date on which the child attains 18 years of 
                age.
            (2) Follow-up services provided to certain unaccompanied 
        alien children released to sponsors under section 235 of the 
        William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection 
        Reauthorization Act of 2008 (8 U.S.C. 1232) are valuable to 
        help ensure child safety, integration, and appearance at 
        immigration court proceedings.

SEC. 3. RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE OF REFUGEE 
              RESETTLEMENT.

                authorized to care for and provide follow-up services 
                to an unaccompanied alien child, including any such 
                child placed with a sponsor, from the time the child is 
                identified as an unaccompanied alien child until the 
                earlier of--
                            ``(i) the date on which the immigration 
                        proceedings of such child are concluded; or

                welfare or emergency services provider to address an 
                allegation of abuse or neglect or an emergency 
                situation.
            ``(6) Follow-up services.--Before placing an unaccompanied 
        alien child with a sponsor, the Director of the Office of 
        Refugee Resettlement shall evaluate, to the extent possible, 
        the need for such child to receive follow-up services once such 
        child is placed with a sponsor.''.
