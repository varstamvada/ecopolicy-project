  Mr. Inhofe (for himself, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Grassley, Mr.

_______________________________________________________________________

                                 A BILL


 
To require the issuance of medals to recognize the dedication and valor 
                    of Native American code talkers.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Code Talkers Recognition Act of 
2008''.

SEC. 2. PURPOSE.

    The purpose of this Act is to require the issuance of medals to 
express the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the service of Native American code talkers to the 
        United States deserves immediate recognition for dedication and 
        valor; and
            (2) honoring Native American code talkers is long overdue.

SEC. 3. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) when the United States entered World War I, Native 
        Americans were not accorded the status of citizens of the 
        United States;
            (2) without regard to that lack of citizenship, members of 
        Indian tribes and nations enlisted in the Armed Forces to fight 
        on behalf of the United States;
            (3) the first reported use of Native American code talkers 
        was on October 17, 1918;
            (4)(A) during World War I, Choctaw code talkers were the 
        first code talkers who played a role in United States military 
        operations by transmitting vital communications that helped 
        defeat German forces in Europe;
            (B) because the language used by the Choctaw code talkers 
        in the transmission of information was not based on a European 
        language or on a mathematical progression, the Germans were 
        unable to understand any of the transmissions;
            (C) this was the first time in modern warfare that such a 
        transmission of messages in a native language was used for the 
        purpose of confusing an enemy;
            (5) on December 7, 1941, Japan attacked Pearl Harbor, 
        Hawaii, and Congress declared war the following day;
            (6)(A) the Federal Government called on the Comanche Nation 
        to support the military effort during World War II by 
        recruiting and enlisting Comanche men to serve in the Army to 
        develop a secret code based on the Comanche language;
            (B) the Army recruited approximately 50 Native Americans 
        for special native language communication assignments; and
            (C) the Marines recruited several hundred Navajos for duty 
        in the Pacific region;
            (7)(A) during World War II, the United States employed 
        Native American code talkers who developed secret means of 
        communication based on native languages and were critical to 
        winning the war; and
            (B) to the frustration of the enemies of the United States, 
        the code developed by the Native American code talkers proved 
        to be unbreakable and was used extensively throughout the 
        European theater;
            (8) in 2001, Congress and President Bush honored Navajo 
        code talkers with congressional gold medals for the 
        contributions of the code talkers to the United States Armed 
        Forces as radio operators during World War II;
            (9) soldiers from the Assiniboine, Cherokee, Cheyenne, 
        Chippewa/Oneida, Choctaw, Comanche, Cree, Crow, Hopi, Kiowa, 
        Menominee, Meskwaki, Mississauga, Muscogee, Osage, Pawnee, Sac 
        and Fox, Seminole, and Sioux (Lakota and Dakota) Indian tribes 
        and nations also served as code talkers during World War II;
            (10) the heroic and dramatic contributions of Native 
        American code talkers were instrumental in driving back Axis 
        forces across the Pacific during World War II; and
            (11) Congress should provide to all Native American code 
        talkers the recognition the code talkers deserve for the 
        contributions of the code talkers to United States victories in 
        World War I and World War II.
