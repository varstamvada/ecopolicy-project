                                 A BILL


 
   To prohibit the expansion of immigration detention facilities, to 
   improve the oversight of such facilities, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLES.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Detention Oversight, Not Expansion 
Act'' or the ``DONE Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Despite a significant decrease in border apprehensions, 
        the Federal immigrant detention system expanded dramatically 
        between 1994 and 2018, with the average daily population of 
        detained noncitizens increasing from fewer than 7,000 during 
        fiscal year 1994 to 39,322 during fiscal year 2018. This 
        population consisted of increasing numbers of children and 
        women, including pregnant women.
            (2) U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (referred to 
        in this section as ``ICE'') inspections of detention facilities 
        are performed by field offices, facility staff, or divisions 
        within ICE headquarters and are not conducted by independent 
        third parties. Since the inspectors are not independent, they 
        often misrepresent conditions inside the facilities and rarely 
        impose consequences for violations. For example, an outside 
        review of 8 facilities concluded that although ICE identified 
        violations of medical standards as contributing factors to 
        deaths in detention, routine ICE detention facility inspections 
        before and even after the deaths failed to acknowledge (and 
        even dismissed) those violations.
            (3) Multiple Federal oversight bodies, including the 
        Department of Homeland Security's Office of Inspector General, 
        ICE's Advisory Committee on Family Residential Centers, and the 
        Government Accountability Office, have documented poor 
        conditions and inhumane detainee treatment, including medical 
        negligence, in immigration detention facilities.
            (4) Since 2003, more than 170 deaths have been reported in 
        immigration detention facilities, a significant number of which 
        resulted from egregious violations of ICE medical care 
        standards, which were often overlooked during ICE inspections 
        of facilities.
            (5) The Department of Homeland Security Office for Civil 
        Rights and Civil Liberties and the Office of Inspector General 
        have received formal complaints and numerous allegations of 
        inadequate medical care for pregnant women who are in custody 
        in such facilities.
            (6) Responses by the Department of Homeland Security to 
        Freedom of Information Act requests suggest that fewer than 3 
        percent of the claims of sexual and physical abuse of detainees 
        in such facilities have been investigated by the Office of 
        Inspector General.
            (7) Multiple Federal oversight bodies, including the 
        Homeland Security Advisory Council, have documented limited 
        oversight and management accountability of immigration 
        detention facilities, including a lack of reasonable 
        inspections and deficient contracting practices.
            (8) Legal service providers allege that some immigration 
        detention facilities have unreasonably restricted legal 
        visitation and access in violation of applicable requirements, 
        raising serious due process concerns.
            (9) The Department of Homeland Security seeks to vastly 
        expand the immigration detention system despite the 
        availability of a wide array of community-based alternatives to 
        detention that provide a cheaper, more compassionate, rights 
        respecting response to migration.
            (10) In June 2017, the Department of Homeland Security 
        terminated the Family Case Management Program, an alternative 
        to detention that--
                    (A) had proved far less expensive than detention; 
                and
                    (B) resulted in close to a 100 percent compliance 
                rate by participants.
