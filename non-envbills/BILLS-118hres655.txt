Recognizing the historical contributions and value of Houston's 7 major 
                          Black publications.

Whereas this resolution may be cited as the ``Original Resolution Honoring 
        Houston's Seven Major Black Newspapers'';
Whereas the City of Houston takes pride in its rich, vibrant cultural and 
        historical tapestry, the depth and breadth of which is largely due to 
        the contributions of its diverse communities;
Whereas historically Black publications have played a critical role in providing 
        a platform for the voiceless, and shaping public discourse for 
        generations;
Whereas Houston has been the birthplace and home of 7 preeminent Black 
        publications, including the Houston Informer, Houston Defender, Forward 
        Times, Houston Sun, Houston Style, African American News and Issues, and 
        D-MARS.com;
Whereas the Houston Informer was established in 1919 to provide African 
        Americans with a powerful voice for democracy, enhanced education, 
        equality, and improved infrastructure, becoming an invaluable part of 
        the fiber and fabric of Houston;
Whereas the Houston Defender, since its inception in 1930, has served as a 
        relentless sentinel, focusing on socioeconomic issues and defending the 
        rights and interests of the African-American community, and contributing 
        to the city's vibrant tapestry of diversity;
Whereas the Forward Times, a cornerstone of the community and self-publication 
        since 1960, has made significant contributions to the elevation of 
        African-American voices, serving as a beacon for transformative societal 
        change;
Whereas the Houston Sun, initiated in 1983, has illuminated the triumphs, 
        challenges, and experiences of the African-American community, being a 
        voice for its constituents;
Whereas the Houston Style commits itself to providing the public with a 
        comprehensive representation of the issues the African-American 
        community in Houston cares about, both in popular culture and the news;
Whereas African American News and Issues, established in 1996, has focused on 
        addressing real-time news directly impacting the African-American 
        community across Texas and encouraging healthy dialogue on key issues;
Whereas D-MARS.com, since its founding in 2001, has devoted itself to promote 
        positive, informative, and inspirational stories that transform and 
        uplift the African-American community; and
Whereas the contributions of these Black publications have not only been 
        instrumental in chronicling the past, but they continue to inspire, 
        educate, and empower present and future generations: Now, therefore, be 
        it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) commends and recognizes the invaluable work and 
        enduring legacy of these 7 Black publications in Houston, their 
        dedication to journalism, their empowerment of the African-
        American community, and their overall enrichment of Houston's 
        cultural and historical tapestry;
            (2) acknowledges the vital role played by these 
        institutions in elevating voices and shaping narratives within 
        the African-American community and society at large, to ensure 
        that diversity, inclusivity, and justice become accessible to 
        all in the democratic society of the United States; and
            (3) expresses sincere gratitude to the Houston Informer, 
        Houston Defender, Forward Times, Houston Sun, Houston Style, 
        African American News and Issues, and D-MARS.com for their 
        unwavering commitment to the truth, community service, and 
        their remarkable contributions to the history and vitality of 
        the City of Houston.
