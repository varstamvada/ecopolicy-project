        Virginia, and Washington;
Whereas first- and second-generation Vietnamese Americans have overcome 
        tremendous socioeconomic challenges, including discrimination, language 
        and cultural barriers, and poverty, to emerge as significant 
        contributors to American society;
Whereas Vietnamese Americans contribute to American society through their work 
        in business, education, science and technology, engineering, 
        mathematics, literature and the arts, gastronomy, the Armed Forces, and 
        public service at every level of government;
Whereas Vietnamese Americans support the advancement of religious freedom, 
        democracy, and human rights around the world; and
