_______________________________________________________________________

                               RESOLUTION


 
 Designating April 8, 2007, as ``National Cushing's Syndrome Awareness 
                                 Day''.

Whereas Cushing's Syndrome annually affects an estimated 10 to 15 people per 
        million, most of whom are currently between the ages of 20 and 50;
Whereas Cushing's Syndrome is an endocrine or hormonal disorder caused by 
        prolonged exposure of the body's tissue to high levels of the hormone 
        cortisol;
Whereas exposure to cortisol can occur by overproduction in the body or by 
        taking glucocorticoid hormones, which are routinely prescribed for 
        asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, or as an immunosuppressant 
        following transplantation;
Whereas the syndrome may also result from pituitary adenomas, ectopic ACTH 
        syndrome, adrenal tumors, and Familial Cushing's Syndrome;
Whereas Cushing's Syndrome can cause abnormal weight gain, skin changes, and 
        fatigue and ultimately lead to diabetes, high blood pressure, 
        depression, osteoporosis, and death;
Whereas Cushing's Syndrome is diagnosed through a series of tests, often 
        requiring x-ray examinations of adrenal or pituitary glands to locate 
        tumors;
Whereas many people who suffer from Cushing's Syndrome are misdiagnosed or go 
        undiagnosed for years because many of the symptoms are mirrored in 
        milder diseases, thereby delaying important treatment options;
Whereas treatments for Cushing's Syndrome include surgery, radiation, 
        chemotherapy, cortisol-inhibiting drugs, and reducing the dosage of 
        glucocorticoid hormones;
Whereas Cushing's Syndrome was discovered by Dr. Harvey Williams Cushing, who 
        was born on April 8th, 1869;
Whereas the Dr. Harvey Cushing stamp was part of the United States Postal 
        Service's ``Great American'' series, initiated in 1980 to recognize 
        individuals for making significant contributions to the heritage and 
        culture of the United States;
Whereas President Ronald Reagan spoke on April 8, 1987, in the Rose Garden at a 
        White House ceremony to unveil the commemorative stamp honoring Dr. 
        Harvey Cushing;
Whereas following the ceremony, President Reagan hosted a reception in the State 
        Dining Room for Mrs. John Hay Whitney, Dr. Cushing's daughter, and 
        representatives of the American Association of Neurological Surgeons; 
        and
Whereas the Senate is an institution that can raise awareness in the general 
        public and the medical community of Cushing's Syndrome: Now, therefore, 
        be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates April 8, 2007, as ``National Cushing's 
        Syndrome Awareness Day'';
            (2) recognizes that all Americans should become more 
        informed and aware of Cushing's Syndrome;
            (3) calls upon the people of the United States to observe 
        the date with appropriate ceremonies and activities; and
            (4) directs the Secretary of the Senate to transmit a copy 
        of this resolution to the Cushing's Understanding, Support & 
        Help Organization.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
