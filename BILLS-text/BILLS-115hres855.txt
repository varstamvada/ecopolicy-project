 Recognizing the Nordic Heritage Museum in Seattle, Washington, as the 
                        National Nordic Museum.

Whereas the Nordic Heritage Museum in Seattle, Washington, is the only museum in 
        the United States dedicated to the history, culture, and art of the 
        Nordic nations;
Whereas Nordic people have long contributed to the rich cultural heritage of the 
        United States;
Whereas the Nordic Heritage Museum serves as a unique and valuable resource 
        locally and nationwide in expanding knowledge of Nordic heritage and its 
        impact throughout the U.S.;
Whereas Nordic history, art, and culture will be even more vibrant and 
        accessible when the Nordic Heritage Museum opens its new state-of-the-
        art museum in 2018;
Whereas the State of Washington, King County, the Nordic Council (comprised of 
        Nordic nations), the national museums of Denmark, Finland, Iceland, 
        Norway, and Sweden, and many private individuals have partnered to 
        provide funds and exhibits for the new Nordic Heritage Museum;
Whereas the Nordic Heritage Museum is a significant resource in preserving and 
        celebrating the immigrant Nordic culture, art, and history;
Whereas the Nordic Heritage Museum is the only museum in the U.S. that exists 
        for the exclusive purpose of preserving, interpreting, and providing 
        education about Nordic culture and heritage;
Whereas the Nordic Heritage Museum promotes valuable international relations 
        with the Nordic countries of Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and 
        Sweden; and
Whereas it is appropriate to designate the Nordic Heritage Museum in Seattle, 
        Washington, as the ``National Nordic Museum'': Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives recognizes the Nordic 
Heritage Museum of Seattle, Washington, as the ``National Nordic 
Museum''.
