                               RESOLUTION


 
Commending the University of Oklahoma Sooners men's gymnastics team for 
 winning the National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I Men's 
                        Gymnastics Championship.

Whereas on April 8, 2005, the University of Oklahoma Sooners won their sixth 
        National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I Men's 
        Gymnastics Championship, at West Point, New York;
Whereas the 2005 NCAA Championship is the Sooners' third championship in the 
        past 4 years;
Whereas the championship title crowned a remarkable season for the Sooners in 
        which the team achieved an impressive record of 21 wins and only 2 
        losses;
Whereas the Sooners clinched a spectacular, nail-biting victory over the Ohio 
        State Buckeyes, which was made possible by a heroic final performance on 
        the vault by freshman Jonathan Horton;
Whereas the Sooners' winning score of 225.675 set a school record and 
        dramatically surpassed second-place Ohio State's score of 225.450;
Whereas 6 members of the University of Oklahoma men's gymnastics team, including 
        Taqiy Abdullah-Simmons, Josh Gore, David Henderson, Jamie Henderson, 
        Jonathan Horton, and Jacob Messina, also garnered a school-record 13 
        All-America honors in the individual event finals;
Whereas senior David Henderson's 2005 NCAA title on the still rings gave the 
        University of Oklahoma its 18th all-time individual national champion 
        and capped off an exceptional 4 years;
Whereas Head Coach Mark Williams was named the 2005 NCAA Coach of the Year, 
        making it the third time in his distinguished career that Head Coach 
        Williams has received that honor;
Whereas the tremendous success of the 2005 Sooners adds to the outstanding 
        legacy of men's gymnastics at the University of Oklahoma and is a 
        reflection of the heart and dedication of the entire school, from the 
        president to the athletic directors, coaches, athletes, managers, and 
        staff members; and
Whereas the teamwork, grit, and sportsmanship demonstrated by the University of 
        Oklahoma Sooners men's gymnastics team is a proud tribute to the 
        university and the communities from which the team members hail: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) congratulates the University of Oklahoma Sooners for 
        their sixth National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I 
        Men's Gymnastics Championship;
            (2) recognizes all who have contributed their hard work and 
        support to making the 2005 season a historic success; and
            (3) directs the Secretary of the Senate to transmit a copy 
        of this resolution to University of Oklahoma President David L. 
        Boren and Head Coach Mark Williams for appropriate display.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
