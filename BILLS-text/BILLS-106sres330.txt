                   IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES

                             June 29, 2000

Mr. Inhofe submitted the following resolution; which was read twice and 
               referred to the Committee on the Judiciary

_______________________________________________________________________

                               RESOLUTION


 
   Designating the week beginning September 24, 2000, as ``National 
                       Amputee Awareness Week''.

Whereas current research indicates that more than 1.5 million Americans, of all 
        ages and of both genders, have had amputations;
Whereas every year 156,000 individuals in the United States lose a limb;
Whereas each month 13,000 individuals lose a limb;
Whereas each week 2,996 individuals lose a limb;
Whereas each day 428 individuals lose a limb;
Whereas becoming an amputee is a lifetime condition, not just a temporary 
        circumstance;
Whereas prosthetic care can range in cost from $8,000 to more than $70,000 
        depending on the level of care and function of the patient;
Whereas most insurance policies cover prosthetics with the stipulation of one 
        prosthesis per patient for life;
Whereas the average prosthesis lasts between three and five years;
Whereas the general public is unaware of the plight of the amputee community;
Whereas an increased awareness to the issues faced by the amputee community will 
        also bring about increased awareness for further research; and
Whereas establishing ``National Amputee Awareness Week'' will bring the cause of 
        amputee awareness to the national front: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) proclaims the week of September 24, through September 
        30, 2000, as ``National Amputee Awareness Week''; and
            (2) requests that the President issue a proclamation 
        calling upon the people of the United States, interested 
        groups, and affected persons to promote the awareness of the 
        amputee community, and to observe the week with appropriate 
        ceremonies and activities.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
