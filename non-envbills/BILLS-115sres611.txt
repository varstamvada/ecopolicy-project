                   IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES

                            August 21, 2018

   Mr. Cassidy (for himself and Mr. Perdue) submitted the following

_______________________________________________________________________

                               RESOLUTION


 
   Opposing the targeted harassment of U.S. Immigration and Customs 
  Enforcement officers and employees and reaffirming the fundamental 
   principle that public safety services should be provided without 
                            discrimination.

Whereas Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a candidate for Congress from New York, 
        welcomed the support of Occupy ICE LA, a group that called U.S. 
        Immigration and Customs Enforcement (in this preamble referred to as 
        ``ICE'') a ``genocidal ethnic cleansing machine'' and ``the Gestapo'', 
        and posted photos of ICE employees on the internet, encouraging 
        activists to ``[k]now their faces, never allow them to feel safe'';
Whereas Cynthia Nixon, a candidate for Governor of New York, stated that ICE 
        ``is a terrorist organization'';
Whereas a mob of leftwing activists recently surrounded an ICE office in 
        southwest Portland, Oregon, trapping ICE employees inside the building;
Whereas ICE employees were subjected to doxxing and violent threats after their 
        social media profiles, phone numbers, and home addresses were posted on 
        the internet by leftwing activists;
Whereas an ICE officer was reportedly followed and ``confronted when he went to 
        pick up his daughter from summer camp'', and another ``had his name and 
        photo plastered on flyers outside his home accusing him of being part of 
        the `Gestapo','' according to the Wall Street Journal;
Whereas the Mayor of Portland, Oregon, Ted Wheeler, barred the Portland Police 
        Bureau from coming to the aid of ICE employees, stating, ``I do not want 
        the @PortlandPolice to be engaged or sucked into a conflict, 
        particularly from a Federal agency that I believe is on the wrong track 
        . . . If they are looking for a bailout from this mayor, they are 
        looking in the wrong place.'';
Whereas the ICE office in southwest Portland was shut down for days due to 
        threats and occupation;
Whereas leftwing activists have similarly harassed and threatened ICE employees 
        and targeted ICE offices for closure around the country;
Whereas the National Immigration and Customs Enforcement Council's 
        representative stated in a letter to Mayor Ted Wheeler that ``[y]our 
        current policy forbidding Portland law enforcement agencies from 
        assisting employees of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency 
        who request law enforcement assistance while at or away from work'' 
        leaves ``them vulnerable to violence, harassment and even death . . . 
        Your policy has created a zone of terror and lawlessness. We ask that 
        you end your policy of not responding to calls for police services from 
        ICE employees immediately. Our membership has been the subjected to 
        threats of physical violence and harassment since you announced your 
        policy.''; and
Whereas the President of the Portland Police Association, Daryl Turner, stated, 
        ``There is no place for personal, political bias when it comes to 
        providing public safety services to our communities. In that respect, 
        our Mayor, who is also our Police Commissioner, has failed miserably.'': 
        Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) expresses solidarity with the men and women of U.S. 
        Immigration and Customs Enforcement who bring human 
        traffickers, drug traffickers, gang members, and violent 
        criminals to justice;
            (2) condemns the doxxing and targeted harassment of all 
        officers and employees of U.S. Immigration and Customs 
        Enforcement and the violent threats they continue to endure 
        from leftwing activists; and
            (3) calls on the Mayor of Portland, Oregon, Ted Wheeler, to 
        immediately resign so that a leader committed to protecting all 
        law-abiding citizens and public servants from harm can assume 
        the duties of Mayor of Portland.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
