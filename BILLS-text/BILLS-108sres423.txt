 Mr. Inhofe submitted the following resolution; which was referred to 
                    the Committee on Indian Affairs

_______________________________________________________________________

                               RESOLUTION


 
      Commending Inez Sitter for her service to the United States.

Whereas the United States, and subsequently the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma, have 
        operated a school at Hartshorne, Oklahoma, called the Jones Academy for 
        more than 100 years, a facility that, since 1952, has provided 
        residential services to predominately at-risk children from more than 20 
        Indian tribes throughout the United States who attend local, public 
        school academic classes;
Whereas for approximately half that time, Mrs. Inez Sitter has been a vital part 
        of that school and its efforts to educate American Indian children;
Whereas Mrs. Sitter came to the school in an administrative post in March of 
        1944 and progressed through various administrative capacities to be the 
        Administrative Assistant at the school;
Whereas Mrs. Sitter formally retired from the Bureau of Indian Affairs in 1983, 
        after 39 years of service;
Whereas Mrs. Sitter immediately thereafter assumed the position as the Study 
        Hall/Tutorial Coordinator for Jones Academy, the Library Services 
        Coordinator, and the Director of the critically important Foster 
        Grandparents program at the school, positions she has held to this day;
Whereas Mrs. Sitter, who is a member of many civic organizations, including the 
        Hartshorne Edgewood United Methodist Church, the Daughters of the 
        American Revolution, and the American Legion Auxiliary, is known 
        throughout the community for her extra work with students, including 
        mentoring, tutoring, and preparation of homework and term assignments;
Whereas for such work she gained a position of advocate for the children of 
        Jones Academy and the de facto position of liaison with the local public 
        school in Hartshorne;
Whereas Mrs. Sitter, who resided with her family on campus, became a surrogate 
        parent for hundreds of Jones Academy children;
Whereas Mrs. Sitter has been described by a colleague as ``87 years young, and 
        only 95 pounds, but with 60 years of service to the children of Jones 
        Academy and the people of Hartshorne, the State of Oklahoma, and these 
        United States''; and
Whereas the Bureau of Indian Affairs, recognizing her selfless and outstanding 
        contributions, awarded Mrs. Sitter its Lifetime Achievement Award, 
        presented by Assistant Secretary Dave Anderson on August 3, 2004: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate commends Mrs. Inez Sitter for her 
outstanding service to the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma, the State of 
Oklahoma, and the United States.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
