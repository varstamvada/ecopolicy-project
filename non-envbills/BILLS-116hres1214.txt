                               RESOLUTION


 
Recognizing the accomplishments and contributions of Sikh Americans and 
                            Sikhs worldwide.

Whereas Sikhism was founded by Guru Nanak who exhorted to his followers to--

    (1) remember God;

    (2) earn their living by honest means; and

    (3) share it with the less fortunate;

Whereas Guru Nanak proclaimed that all men and women are equal, and criticized 
        caste inequality and other forms of social injustice;
Whereas 2019 marked the 550th anniversary of the birth of Guru Nanak;
Whereas Sikhism teaches peace, reconciliation, and overcoming differences to 
        build community;
Whereas Sikhism is the world's fifth largest religion, with more than 25,000,000 
        followers worldwide and about 1,000,000 in the United States;
Whereas Sikhs first arrived in the United States in 1899, and many early 
        pioneers worked to build the Nation's railroads and other pieces of 
        critical infrastructure;
Whereas, by 1910, many Sikh pioneers had begun agriculture enterprises and 
        helped feed the people of the United States;
Whereas the first Sikh gurdwara was established in Stockton, California, in 
        1912, and continues to operate in the present day;
Whereas there are now more than 200 gurdwaras in the United States;
Whereas Sikhs have fought courageously for and alongside the United States in 
        every conflict since World War I;
Whereas despite these undeniable contributions to American society, Sikhs have 
        faced discrimination in the United States;
Whereas World War I veteran Bhagat Singh Thind courageously campaigned for the 
        right of Sikhs and East Indians to become citizens, but was denied this 
        right by the Supreme Court in the 1923 case United States v. Bhagat 
        Singh Thind;
Whereas legislation to authorize Sikhs and other East Indian immigrants to 
        naturalize as United States citizens was not enacted until 1946;
Whereas, in 1957, Dalip Singh Saund became the first Sikh American, the first 
        Indian American, and the first Asian American elected to the United 
        States House of Representatives;
Whereas Sikh Americans today still face attacks on their identity and culture, 
        including hate crimes that tragically claim lives, as in Elk Grove, 
        California, in 2011 and Oak Creek, Wisconsin, in 2012;
Whereas despite this troubling history, Sikh Americans today have overcome these 
        challenges to become successful in all aspects of American life and 
        openly celebrate their culture through events at gurdwaras, parades, and 
        festivals;
Whereas members of the Sikh community continue to make outstanding contributions 
        to the economic vibrancy of the region in industries including 
        agriculture, transportation, education, medicine, and retail;
Whereas the Sikh community's generous philanthropy has assisted many and serves 
        as a testimony of the commitment of Sikhs to the teachings of Guru Nanak 
        and their love of country;
Whereas Sikh elected officials increasingly and proudly represent their 
        respective communities in public office;
Whereas the patriotic efforts of Lieutenant Colonel Kamal Kalsi helped open the 
        door to Sikhs serving their country in the Armed Forces while 
        maintaining their religious traditions and culture;
Whereas an increasing number of Sikh young people have been inspired by 
        Lieutenant Colonel Kalsi's example and have enlisted in the Armed Forces 
        in recent years; and
Whereas Sikh Americans have been an invaluable part of the United States for 
        more than a century, and the Sikh American community continues to make 
        unique cultural contributions that enrich the diversity of American 
        life: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) recognizes the discrimination that Sikhs have faced and 
        continue to face in the United States and elsewhere, and 
        condemns all acts of bias and hatred against the Sikh 
        community;
            (2) expresses its respect and gratitude for the 
        contributions of all Sikh Americans, both historically and in 
        the present day; and
            (3) encourages all Americans to recognize and celebrate the 
        unique history and culture of the Sikh community.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
