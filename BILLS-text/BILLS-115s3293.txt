                                 A BILL


 
         To provide for the use of unleaded aviation gasoline.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. AVIATION FUEL.

    (a) Use of Unleaded Aviation Gasoline.--The Administrator of the 
Federal Aviation Administration (in this section referred to as the 
``Administrator'') shall allow the use of an unleaded aviation gasoline 
in an aircraft as a replacement for a leaded gasoline if the 
Administrator--
            (1) determines that the unleaded aviation gasoline 
        qualifies as a replacement for an approved leaded gasoline;
            (2) identifies the aircraft and engines that are eligible 
        to use the qualified replacement unleaded gasoline; and
            (3) adopts a process (other than the traditional means of 
        certification) to allow eligible aircraft and engines to 
        operate using qualified replacement unleaded gasoline in a 
        manner that ensures safety.
    (b) Timing.--The Administrator shall adopt the process described in 
subsection (a)(3) not later than 180 days after the later of--
            (1) the date on which the Administration completes the 
        Piston Aviation Fuels Initiative; or
            (2) the date on which the American Society for Testing and 
        Materials publishes a production specification for an unleaded 
        aviation gasoline.
    (c) Other Means and Methods.--Any other existing regulatory 
mechanism by which the use of an unleaded aviation gasoline can be 
approved, either directly, or by a Supplemental Type Certificate for 
individual aircraft and engines or by use of an Approved Model List 
Supplemental Type Certificate providing coverage for all, or 
substantially all, of the entire fleet of aircraft and engines 
identified in the Federal Aviation Administration databases, shall 
continue to be fully available as a means of approving and bringing an 
unleaded aviation gasoline into general use in the United States. Such 
existing regulatory mechanisms shall not be further conditioned on the 
success, failure, or timing of the progress of the Piston Aviation 
Fuels Initiative, nor dependent upon a specification approved by the 
American Society for Testing and Materials.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
