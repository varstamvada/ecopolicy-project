        dishonored.
    ``(c) Preservation of Trust.--An unpaid cash seller shall lose the 
benefit of a trust under subsection (b) if the unpaid cash seller has 
not preserved the trust by--

        benefits of the trust; and

the livestock held in that trust.

            ``(1) In general.--A buyer in the ordinary course that 
        purchases livestock that is held in trust by a dealer under 
        subsection (b) shall receive good title to the livestock free 
        of the dealer trust if the buyer receives the livestock--
                    ``(A) in exchange for payment of new value; and
                    ``(B) in good faith and without notice that the

            ``(2) to a secured party pursuant to a security agreement.
    ``(g) Enforcement.--
            ``(1) In general.--The Secretary shall carry out at least 
        one of the enforcement activities described in paragraph (2) if 
        the Secretary has reason to believe that--
                    ``(A) a dealer has failed to perform the duties 
                required by subsection (b) with respect to a trust 
                under that subsection; or
                    ``(B) carrying out an enforcement activity is in 
                the best interest of an unpaid cash seller.

        referred to in paragraph (1) are the following:

                of the United States for the judicial district in which 
                the dealer resides--
                            ``(i) to enjoin a dealer from performing 
                        the duties required by subsection (b); and
