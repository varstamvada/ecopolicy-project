                                 A BILL


 
   To address systemic racism through the arts and humanities in the 
                             United States.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Advancing Equity Through the Arts 
and Humanities Act of 2022''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Access to the arts and cultural programming influences 
        positive social determinants and is integral to healthy 
        communities.
            (2) In America, the received narrative is that the arts are 
        for entertainment or for artists, but a deeper look shows the 
        profound effect access to the arts has on those most impacted 
        by the justice system, children, veterans, low-income 
        communities, and self-designated non-artists.
            (3) Concentrated cultural districts are associated with 
        reduced poverty without neighborhood displacement, improved 
        child welfare, and lower morbidity.
            (4) Low-income neighborhoods with cultural resources have 
        14 percent fewer cases of child abuse and neglect, and 18 
        percent less serious crime than low-income neighborhoods 
        without cultural resources.
            (5) Low-income students who participate in the arts, both 
        in school and after school, have a dropout rate of just 4 
        percent or 5 times lower than their peers. Children with access 
        to arts programming in schools showed a 22.55 percent 
        improvement in math proficiency, a 12.62 percent improvement in 
        reading, and suspensions were reduced by as much as 89 percent.
            (6) Seventy-one percent of at-risk students with high arts 
        involvement attend college, whereas only 48 percent of at-risk 
        students with low arts involvement attend college.
            (7) Participation in after-school arts programs causes 
        juvenile crime to fall by 4.2 percent on average, and slightly 
        more (5.4 percent) in lower-income cities.
            (8) Arts programming in prisons showed an 89-percent drop 
        in infractions.
            (9) The cultural economy is significant not only in cities, 
        but also in rural and tribal communities. Forty percent of 
        Native American households on the Pine Ridge Reservation in 
        Kyle, South Dakota, depend on home-based arts enterprises.
            (10) The arts heal the mental, physical, and moral injuries 
        of war for military servicemembers and veterans, as well as aid 
        in their reintegration into the community.
            (11) Arts and culture is an $878,000,000,000 industry in 
        the U.S. (nonprofit, commercial, education). The nonprofit arts 
        industry alone generates $166,300,000,000 in annual economic 
        activity spending by organizations and their audience, which 
        supports 4,600,000 jobs and generates $27,500,000,000 in 
        government revenue.
            (12) The National Endowment for the Arts is the only arts 
        funder in the United States, public or private, that provides 
        access to the arts in all 50 States, the District of Columbia, 
        and territories of the United States.
            (13) Many of the most far-reaching victories for racial 
        healing in the United States have been greatly enhanced by the 
        involvement, support, and dedication of individuals from any 
        and all racial groups.
            (14) At the same time, much of the progress toward racial 
        healing and racial equity in the United States has been limited 
        or reversed by our failure to address the root cause of racism, 
        the belief in the myth of a hierarchy of human value based on 
        superficial physical characteristics such as skin color and 
        facial features.
            (15) Limited arts access is linked to economic and racial 
        inequities as well as resource deprivation.
            (16) Arts organizations serving communities of color are, 
        in general, much less financially secure and far smaller than 
        their counterparts in White communities. The median budgets of 
        the 20 largest arts organizations serving communities of color 
        in a given discipline, such as dance, theater, or music, were 
        more than 90 percent smaller than the budgets of the largest 
        organizations in that discipline.
            (17) Children of color, who make up the overwhelming 
        percentage of the children living in poverty in the United 
        States, and other students with lower socioeconomic status, 
        have a lower probability of accessing arts education.
            (18) Access to arts education declined significantly more 
        for Black and Brown students than it did for White children 
        between 1982 and 2008. There was less than a 2 percent decrease 
        for White children, while there was a 49 percent decrease for 
        Black children and a 40 percent decrease for Latin children.
            (19) The arts are in everyone. Everyone should have access 
        to the arts.
            (20) Racial and ethnic inequality is a result of systematic 
        and internalized racism and racist public and private policies 
        and practices. Dismantling structural racism through the arts 
        and humanities is critical to the health of our Nation.
