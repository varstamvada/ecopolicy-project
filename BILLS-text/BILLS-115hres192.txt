                               RESOLUTION


 
   Expressing the deepest sympathy and condolences to the family of 
Srinivas Kuchibhotla, as well as to Alok Madasani, Ian Grillot, and all 
victims of hate crime throughout the United States, and calling on the 
  Department of Justice and the President to take appropriate actions.

Whereas on February 22, 2017, Srinivas Kuchibhotla and Alok Madasani were shot 
        at a restaurant in Olathe, Kansas, by a visitor who witnesses indicate 
        said ``get out of my country'' before opening fire;
Whereas Ian Grillot intervened to try and stop the killer and was shot by the 
        same assailant;
Whereas Srinivas Kuchibhotla perished from the wounds he received at the scene;
Whereas Srinivas Kuchibhotla is survived by his family;
Whereas attacks and threats have increased against Hindu, Muslim, Arab, South 
        Asian, Sikh, and Jewish Americans;
Whereas a Sikh American was shot and injured in Kent, Washington, on March 3, 
        2017, by a gunman who reportedly told him to ``go back to your own 
        country'';
Whereas a report released from South Asian Americans Leading Together (SAALT) 
        found that hate violence against key communities during the most recent 
        measured year was 34 percent higher than the combined 3-year period 
        between 2011 and 2014;
Whereas the Department of Justice rightfully began tracking hate crimes against 
        Hindu, Sikh, and Arab Americans in 2015;
Whereas the attacks on Srinivas Kuchibhotla and Alok Madasani, and other hate 
        incidents across the country, have impacted Indian-American families 
        throughout the United States, sowing fear and concern;
Whereas South Asian American and other groups across the United States have 
        condemned these attacks;
Whereas South Asian Americans and other immigrant communities are too often 
        painted as threats rather than valued for their contributions to this 
        Nation; and
Whereas the President's rhetoric and actions are terrifying many American 
        families: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) expresses its deepest sympathy and condolences to the 
        families of Srinivas Kuchibhotla, as well as to Alok Madasani, 
        Ian Grillot, and all victims of hate crime throughout the 
        United States;
            (2) urges the Department of Justice to carry out a full 
        hate crime investigation into these attacks and ensure that 
        adequate funding and resources are available to carry out other 
        hate crimes investigations, including additional funding for 
        Civil Rights Division prosecutors and Community Relations 
        Service professionals; and
            (3) calls on the President to end his inflammatory rhetoric 
        and policies, which have created a climate of fear within and 
        amongst communities across the country.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
