 To authorize the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency 
     to award grants and contracts for projects that use emerging 
    technologies to address threats to water quality, and for other 
                               purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

     This Act may be cited as the ``Water Quality and Environmental 
Innovation Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Science, technology, and innovation are major 
        cornerstones of the economy of the United States.
            (2) Throughout the United States, there is a growing 
        momentum to address traditional and emerging threats to the 
        Nation's water resources through innovative technological 
        approaches.
            (3) Water quality continues to negatively impact 
        communities in the United States in a variety of ways.
            (4) Water quality improvement and protection efforts pose a 
        unique opportunity for private and public innovators to develop 
        lasting market-based solutions.

SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the Federal Government should support innovative 
        solutions to address water quality in the United States;
            (2) forward-thinking applications of new and existing 
        technologies will be vital for the ability of communities in 
        the United States to treat and monitor vital aquatic and 
        environmental resources;
            (3) supporting an innovative approach to addressing or 
        avoiding water quality degradation will ultimately result in 
        positive changes pertaining to water quality and environmental 
        well-being;
            (4) utilizing emerging technologies will spur market-based 
        innovation and will further amplify the ongoing efforts to 
        resolve water quality degradation; and
            (5) the Environmental Protection Agency and State 
        environmental agencies should prioritize the use of emerging 
        technologies, including artificial intelligence, quantum 
        information science, distributed ledger technology, mechanical 
        harvesting, aquatic muck dredging, living shorelines, living 
        seawalls, robotics, nanotechnology, environmental DNA (eDNA), 
        and cultivation of aquatic species, such as seaweed, seagrass, 
        kelp, clams, oysters, and mussels, when creating programs and 
        solutions to address water quality.
