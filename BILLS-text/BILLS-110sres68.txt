                               RESOLUTION


 
     Commending the Miss America Organization for its longstanding 
   commitment to quality education and the character of women in the 
                             United States.

Whereas the Miss America Organization was formed in 1921;
Whereas, in 1945, the organization established a scholarship program to assist 
        young women achieve their personal and professional goals;
Whereas contestants in the Miss America Pageant must first succeed in local and 
        State pageants;
Whereas the 52 young women who participated in the Miss America Pageant showed 
        great poise and accomplishment;
Whereas Lauren Nelson, of Lawton, Oklahoma, was crowned Miss America 2007, the 
        sixth Oklahoman in history and the second in a row;
Whereas Oklahoma now joins only 2 other States in boasting 6 Miss America crowns 
        and 3 other States in holding consecutive crowns; and
Whereas the Senate family is also proud of Kate Michael of Senator Johnny 
        Isakson's office, who represented the District of Columbia in the Miss 
        America Pageant: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) commends the Miss America Organization for its 
        longstanding commitment to quality education and the character 
        of women in the United States;
            (2) congratulates Miss America 2007, Lauren Nelson of 
        Lawton, Oklahoma, the 80th woman crowned Miss America; and
            (3) directs the Secretary of the Senate to transmit a copy 
        of this resolution to Lauren Nelson in care of the Miss America 
        Organization.
