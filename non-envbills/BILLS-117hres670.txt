 Condemning the inhumane treatment of Haitian migrants at the southern 
                      border of the United States.

Whereas some U.S. Customs and Border Patrol agents have treated the Haitian 
        migrants inhumanely, charging them on horseback while using reins as 
        lashes: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives condemns and denounces 
the actions of those U.S. Customs and Border Patrol agents who 
confronted some Haitian migrants on horseback using their reins as 
lashes.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
