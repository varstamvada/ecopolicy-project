                                 A BILL


 
To provide that no Federal funds may be used to carry out the proposed 
rule of the Department of Homeland Security entitled ``Inadmissibility 
          on Public Charge Grounds'', and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``No Federal Funds for Public Charge 
Act of 2019''.

SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) immigrants and their families are a core part of our 
        Nation;
            (2) their health and safety is critical to the health and 
        safety of our communities;
            (3) Federal, State, and local assistance programs promote 
        self-sufficiency by ensuring that families, including immigrant 
        and mixed-status families, maintain their health, strength, and 
        stability, and can continue contributing to the Nation's social 
        and economic life;
            (4) the proposed rule of the Department of Homeland 
        Security entitled ``Inadmissibility on Public Charge Grounds'' 
        is a sweeping and dangerous proposal that will impede access to 
        essential food, medical care, and housing for many families;
            (5) the proposed rule would damage State and local 
        economies while burdening health and service providers, and the 
        Department of Homeland Security itself, in the preamble of the 
        proposed rule, acknowledges the severe consequences of this 
        proposal including that it could cause ``worse health outcomes, 
        including increased prevalence of obesity and malnutrition, 
        especially for pregnant or breastfeeding women, infants, or 
        children'', that it may ``decrease disposable income and 
        increase the poverty of certain families and children, 
        including U.S. citizen children'' and that it could lead to 
        ``reduced revenues for healthcare providers'', ``pharmacies'', 
        ``companies that manufacture medical supplies or 
        pharmaceuticals'', ``grocery retailers'', and ``agricultural 
        producers''; and
            (6) the proposed rule would circumvent Congress and reverse 
        100 years of law and policy, restricting immigration and 
        chilling access to services for which immigrants and their 
        citizen family members are eligible, in a manner not authorized 
        or contemplated by Congress.

SEC. 3. RESTRICTION ON FEDERAL FUNDS.

    No Federal funds (including fees) made available for any fiscal 
year, may be used to implement, administer, enforce, or carry out the 
proposed rule of the Department of Homeland Security entitled 
``Inadmissibility on Public Charge Grounds''.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
