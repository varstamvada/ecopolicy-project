                               RESOLUTION


 
 Honoring the Hudson River School painters for their contributions to 
                           the United States.

Whereas the Hudson River School was a mid-19th century American art movement led 
        by a group of landscape painters, whose aesthetic vision was influenced 
        by the romanticism movement;
Whereas the Hudson River School is considered the first school of American Art;
Whereas the major Hudson River School painters included Thomas Cole, Frederic 
        Edwin Church, Asher Brown Durand, Jasper Francis Cropsy, Sanford 
        Robinson Gifford, Albert Bierstadt, John Frederick Kensett, George 
        Inness, Worthington Whittredge, and Thomas Moran;
Whereas the Hudson River School paintings capture the striking naturalistic 
        landscape and sweeping beauty of the Hudson River Valley and the 
        surrounding New York areas, including the Catskill, Adirondack, and the 
        White Mountains;
Whereas Hudson River School paintings served as a vital role in cultivating 
        American identity in the mid-19th century and creating a sense of awe of 
        the American landscape that endures today;
Whereas the Hudson River School painters influenced the environmental 
        conservation movement and the establishment of the National Park System 
        under President Theodore Roosevelt;
Whereas the Hudson River School's portrayal of the Hudson River Valley is a 
        major source of tourism in the region;
Whereas 2009 marks the 400th anniversary of the voyages of discovery made by 
        Henry Hudson and Samuel de Champlain, recognizing the important role 
        that the Hudson River and the Hudson Valley played in the development 
        and growth of the United States;
Whereas the Hudson River School painters depicted the Hudson River Valley during 
        the opening of the Erie Canal which linked the Hudson River with the 
        Great Lakes, and created a main trade route from New York that fostered 
        the city's central place in the American economy;
Whereas the Hudson River School painters celebrated the ideals of American 
        democracy, individuality, and progress;
Whereas the Hudson River School painters illustrated themes such as Nature, 
        Conservation, Civility, Unity, Education, Family, Chivalry, and 
        Development;
Whereas the Hudson River School painters expressed the sense that every 
        generation of Americans should seek to preserve the naturalness of the 
        continent; and
Whereas the Hudson River School painters accentuated the cardinal values of the 
        19th century and such their ideals can assist contemporary America in 
        the rebirth of American culture: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives recognizes and honors 
the Hudson River School painters for their contributions to the United 
States.
