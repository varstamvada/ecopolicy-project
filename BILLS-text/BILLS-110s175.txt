To provide for a feasibility study of alternatives to augment the water 
supplies of the Central Oklahoma Master Conservancy District and cities 
                        served by the District.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. CENTRAL OKLAHOMA MASTER CONSERVATORY DISTRICT FEASIBILITY 
              STUDY.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) Thunderbird Lake, located on Little River in central 
        Oklahoma, was constructed in 1965 by the Bureau of Reclamation 
        for flood control, water supply, recreation, and fish and 
        wildlife purposes;
            (2) the available yield of Thunderbird Lake is allocated to 
        the Central Oklahoma Master Conservatory District, which 
        supplies municipal and industrial water supplies to the cities 
        of Norman, Midwest City, and Del City, Oklahoma; and
            (3) studies conducted by the Bureau during fiscal year 2003 
        indicate that the District will require additional water 
        supplies to meet the future needs of the District, including 
        through--
                    (A) the drilling of additional wells;
                    (B) the implementation of a seasonal pool plan at 
                Thunderbird Lake;
                    (C) the construction of terminal storage to hold 
                wet-weather yield from Thunderbird Lake;
                    (D) a reallocation of water storage; and
                    (E) the importation of surplus water from sources 
                outside the basin of Thunderbird Lake.
    (b) Study.--Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of 
this Act, the Commissioner of the Bureau of Reclamation shall conduct a 
feasibility study of alternatives to augment the water supplies of the 
Central Oklahoma Master Conservatory District and cities served by the 
District, including recommendations of the Commissioner, if any.
    (c) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized to be 
appropriated to the Commissioner of the Bureau of Reclamation $300,000 
to conduct the study under subsection (b).
                                 &lt;all&gt;
