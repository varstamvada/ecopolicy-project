                                 A BILL


 
To amend the Community Services Block Grant Act to reauthorize national 
and regional programs designed to provide instructional activities for 
                           low-income youth.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Keep Inspiration and Development 
Strong Act'' or the ``KIDS Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) since 1968, when the National Youth Sports Program 
        (referred to in this Act as the ``Program'') began, the Program 
        has provided a character-building environment for low-income 
        children to develop athletic, educational, and leadership 
        skills;
            (2)(A) the Program utilizes community resources, private 
        funding, and public funding to carry out the Program's goals; 
        and
            (B) for every $1 in Federal funds appropriated for the 
        Program, the Program receives nearly $3 from private sources, 
        through cash contributions or services provided at Program 
        sites;
            (3)(A) the continued investment of Federal resources in the 
        Program is in the Nation's best interest, especially given a 
        recent increase in child obesity in the United States; and
            (B) the Surgeon General's report to the President, 
        published in the fall of 2000 and entitled ``Promoting Better 
        Health for Young People Through Physical Activity and Sports'', 
        indicated that child obesity had doubled in the preceding 20 
        years;
            (4)(A) the Program enhances the health of children by 
        providing quality medical care; and
            (B) in 2001, 77,106 medical examinations were administered 
        at Program sites for children who might otherwise not have 
        visited a doctor;
            (5) the Program encourages educational growth in children 
        by exposing the children to a collegiate atmosphere at an early 
        age and establishing higher education as a natural life goal 
        for the children;
            (6) the Program is truly a national program, expanding in 
        2001 to college and university campuses in 49 States, the 
        District of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico; and
            (7) the Nation can best prepare the children of the United 
        States to embrace their future by encouraging healthy bodies 
        and healthy minds.

SEC. 3. REAUTHORIZATION.

    Section 682(g) of the Community Services Block Grant Act (42 U.S.C. 
9923(g)) is amended to read as follows:
    ``(g) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized to be 
appropriated to carry out this section $20,000,000 for fiscal year 2003 
and such sums as may be necessary for each of fiscal years 2004 through 
2008.''.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
