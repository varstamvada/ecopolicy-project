                                 A BILL


 
To expand visa waiver program to countries on a probationary basis, and 
                          for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Secure Travel and Counterterrorism 
Partnership Act''.

SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    It is the sense of Congress that the United States should expand 
the visa waiver program to extend visa-free travel privileges to 
nationals of foreign countries that are allies in the war on terrorism 
as that expansion will--
            (1) enhance bilateral cooperation on critical 
        counterterrorism and information sharing initiatives;
            (2) support and expand tourism and business opportunities 
        to enhance long-term economic competitiveness; and
            (3) strengthen bilateral relationships.

SEC. 3. VISA WAIVER PROGRAM EXPANSION.

    Section 217(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 
1187(c)) is amended by adding at the end the following:
            ``(8) Probationary participation of program countries.--

                Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with 
                the Secretary of State, shall establish a pilot program 
                to permit not more than 5 foreign countries that are 
                not designated as program countries under paragraph (1) 
                to participate in the program.
