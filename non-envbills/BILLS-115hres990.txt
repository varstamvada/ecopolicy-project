                               RESOLUTION


 
   Supporting the officers and personnel who carry out the important 
   mission of the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

Whereas the national security interests of the United States are dependent on 
        the brave men and women who enforce our Nation's immigration laws;
Whereas abolishing the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) 
        would mean open borders because it would eliminate the agency 
        responsible for removing people who enter or remain in our country 
        illegally;
Whereas calls to abolish ICE are an insult to these heroic law enforcement 
        officers who make sacrifices every day to secure our borders, enforce 
        our laws, and protect our safety and security;
Whereas abolishing ICE would allow dangerous criminal aliens, including violent 
        and ruthless members of the MS-13 gang, to remain in American 
        communities;
Whereas during fiscal year 2017, ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) 
        arrested more than 127,000 aliens with criminal convictions or charges;
Whereas criminal aliens arrested by ICE ERO in fiscal year 2017 were responsible 
        for more than--

    (1) 76,000 dangerous drug offenses;

    (2) 48,000 assault offenses;

    (3) 11,000 weapon offenses;

    (4) 5,000 sexual assault offenses;

    (5) 2,000 kidnapping offenses; and

    (6) 1,800 homicide offenses;

Whereas ICE Homeland Security Investigations made 4,818 gang-related arrests in 
        fiscal year 2017;
Whereas abolishing ICE would mean that countless illegal aliens who could pose a 
        threat to public safety would be allowed to roam free instead of being 
        removed from American soil;
Whereas abolishing ICE would mean more dangerous illegal drugs flowing into our 
        communities, causing more Americans to needlessly suffer;
Whereas ICE plays a critical role in combatting the drug crisis facing our 
        Nation;
Whereas ICE seized more than 980,000 pounds of narcotics in fiscal year 2017, 
        including thousands of pounds of the deadly drugs fueling the opioid 
        crisis;
Whereas ICE seized 2,370 pounds of fentanyl and 6,967 pounds of heroin in fiscal 
        year 2017;
Whereas ICE logged nearly 630,000 investigative hours directed toward fentanyl 
        in fiscal year 2017;
Whereas abolishing ICE would leave these drugs in our communities to cause more 
        devastation;
Whereas abolishing ICE would mean eliminating the agency that deports aliens 
        that pose a terrorist threat to the United States;
Whereas ICE was created in 2003 to better protect national security and public 
        safety after 9/11 terrorists exploited immigration rules to gain entry 
        into the United States;
Whereas the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks found that many of the 9/11 
        hijackers committed visa violations;
Whereas ICE identifies dangerous individuals before they enter our country and 
        locates them as they violate our immigration laws; and
Whereas abolishing ICE would enable the hundreds of thousands of foreign 
        nationals who illegally overstay their visa each year to remain in the 
        United States indefinitely: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) expresses its continued support for all United States 
        Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers and 
        personnel who carry out the important mission of ICE;
            (2) denounces calls for the complete abolishment of ICE; 
        and
            (3) supports the efforts of all Federal agencies, State law 
        enforcement, and military personnel who bring law and order to 
        our Nation's borders.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
