                               RESOLUTION


 
Commending General Peter J. Schoomaker for his extraordinary dedication 
               to duty and service to the United States.

Whereas General Peter J. Schoomaker, the 35th Chief of Staff of the United 
        States Army, will be released from active duty in April 2007, after over 
        35 distinguished years of active Federal service;
Whereas General Schoomaker, a native of Wyoming, graduated from the University 
        of Wyoming in 1969, served in a variety of command and staff assignments 
        with both conventional and special operations forces, including 
        participation in numerous combat operations, such as Desert One in Iran, 
        Urgent Fury in Grenada, Just Cause in Panama, Desert Shield/Desert Storm 
        in Southwest Asia, and Uphold Democracy in Haiti, and supported various 
        worldwide joint contingency operations, including those in the Balkans;
Whereas General Schoomaker has been awarded the Defense Distinguished Service 
        Medal, 2 Army Distinguished Service Medals, 4 Defense Superior Service 
        Medals, 3 Legions of Merit, 2 Bronze Star Medals, 2 Defense Meritorious 
        Service Medals, 3 Meritorious Service Medals, the Joint Service 
        Commendation Medal, the Joint Service Achievement Medal, the Combat 
        Infantryman Badge, the Master Parachutist Badge and HALO Wings, the 
        Special Forces Tab, and the Ranger Tab;
Whereas General Schoomaker was recalled from retirement, spent the last 4 years 
        of his career in the highest position attainable in the Army, and has 
        proven himself a tremendous wartime leader who has demonstrated 
        unselfish devotion to the Nation and the soldiers he leads;
Whereas General Schoomaker's efforts to prepare the Army to fight a long war 
        today while transforming it for an uncertain and complex future have 
        been unprecedented;
Whereas General Schoomaker has demonstrated strategic leadership and vision and 
        has had a remarkably positive and lasting impact on the Army by 
        leveraging the momentum of the Global War on Terror to accelerate the 
        transformation of the Army;
Whereas General Schoomaker, through modularization, rebalancing the total Army, 
        development of a force generation model, restationing, and restructuring 
        the Future Combat Systems, kept the Army focused on developing 
        capabilities to meet traditional, irregular, catastrophic, and 
        disruptive challenges threatening the interests of the United States;
Whereas General Schoomaker recognized that technological and organizational 
        change requires intellectual and emotional transformation and tirelessly 
        cultivated a learning and adaptive Army culture, while reaffirming the 
        predominance of the human dimension of war;
Whereas General Schoomaker reflected the spirit of the warrior ethos he sought 
        to instill in the United States Army--always placing the mission first, 
        never accepting defeat, never quitting, and never leaving a fallen 
        comrade;
Whereas General Schoomaker exemplifies the nonnegotiable characteristics 
        exhibited by all great leaders--a strong sense of duty, honor, courage, 
        and a love of country;
Whereas General Schoomaker has been selfless in his service to the Nation 
        through peace and war;
Whereas one of General Schoomaker's predecessors, George C. Marshall, once 
        remarked that ``it is not enough to fight, it is the spirit we bring to 
        the fight that decides the issue''; and
Whereas when history looks back at the Army's 35th Chief of Staff, it will be 
        clear that he had the spirit at a critical time in the Nation's history: 
        Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) commends General Peter J. Schoomaker for his 
        extraordinary dedication to duty and service to the United 
        States throughout his distinguished career in the U.S. Army; 
        and
            (2) directs the Secretary of the Senate to transmit an 
        enrolled copy of this resolution to General Peter J. 
        Schoomaker.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
