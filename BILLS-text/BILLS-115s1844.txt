                        not request or develop a supplemental NEPA 
                        review of the project, unless the agency--
                                    (I) demonstrates that such a review 
                                is necessary for the agency to carry 
                                out an obligation of the agency with 
                                respect to a Federal authorization for 
                                the project; and
                                    (II) requires information that
