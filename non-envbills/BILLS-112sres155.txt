                               RESOLUTION


 
    Designating April 23, 2011, as ``National Adopt A Library Day''.

Whereas libraries are an essential part of the communities and the national 
        system of education in the United States;
Whereas the people of the United States benefit significantly from libraries 
        that serve as an open place for people of all ages and backgrounds to 
        use books and other resources that offer pathways to learning, self-
        discovery, and the pursuit of knowledge;
Whereas the libraries of the United States depend on the generous donations and 
        the support of individuals and groups to ensure that people who are 
        unable to purchase books still have access to a wide variety of 
        resources;
Whereas certain nonprofit organizations facilitate the donation of books to 
        schools and libraries across the United States, in order to extend the 
        joy of reading to millions of people in the United States and to prevent 
        used books from being thrown away;
Whereas as of the date of agreement to this resolution, the libraries of the 
        United States have provided valuable resources to individuals who are 
        affected by the economic crisis by encouraging continued education and 
        job training; and
Whereas several States that recognize the importance of libraries and reading 
        have adopted resolutions commemorating April 23 as ``Adopt A Library 
        Day'': Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates April 23, 2011, as ``National Adopt A 
        Library Day'';
            (2) honors the organizations that facilitate donations to 
        schools and libraries;
            (3) urges people in the United States who own unused books 
        to donate such books to local libraries;
            (4) strongly supports children and families who take 
        advantage of the resources provided by schools and libraries; 
        and
            (5) encourages the people of the United States to observe 
        ``National Adopt A Library Day'' with appropriate ceremonies 
        and activities.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
