                               RESOLUTION


 
  Commemorating the tenth anniversary of the attack on the Alfred P. 
                        Murrah Federal Building.

Whereas on April 19, 1995, at 9:02 a.m. Central Daylight Time, in Oklahoma City, 
        Oklahoma, the United States was attacked in one of the worst terrorist 
        attacks on United States soil, which killed 168 people and injured more 
        than 850 others;
Whereas this dastardly act of domestic terrorism affected thousands of families 
        and horrified millions of people across the State of Oklahoma and the 
        United States;
Whereas the people of Oklahoma and the United States responded to this tragedy 
        through the remarkable efforts of local, State, and Federal law 
        enforcement, firefighters, and emergency services, search and rescue 
        teams from across the United States, public and private medical 
        personnel, and thousands of volunteers from the community who saved 
        lives, assisted the injured and wounded, comforted the bereaved, and 
        provided meals and support to those who came to Oklahoma City to help 
        those endangered and affected by this terrorist act;
Whereas the people of Oklahoma and the United States pledged themselves to build 
        and maintain a permanent national memorial to remember those who were 
        killed, those who survived, and those changed forever;
Whereas this pledge was fulfilled by creating the Oklahoma City National 
        Memorial, which draws hundreds of thousands of visitors from around the 
        world every year to the site of this tragic event in United States 
        history;
Whereas the Oklahoma City National Memorial brings comfort, strength, peace, 
        hope, and serenity to the many visitors who come to the memorial and its 
        museum each year to remember and to learn;
Whereas the mission of the National Memorial Institute for the Prevention of 
        Terrorism, to aid the Nation's emergency responders in preventing 
        terrorist attacks, or mitigating their effects, should be promoted; and
Whereas the tenth anniversary of the terrorist bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah 
        Federal Building in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, is on April 19, 2005: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) joins with the people of the United States in sending 
        best wishes and prayers to the families, friends, and neighbors 
        of the 168 people killed in the terrorist bombing of the Alfred 
        P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma;
            (2) sends Congress's best wishes and thoughts to those 
        injured in the bombing and its gratitude for their recovery;
            (3) thanks the thousands of first responders, rescue 
        workers, medical personnel, and volunteers from the Oklahoma 
        City community and across the Nation who answered the call for 
        help that April morning and in the days and weeks thereafter;
            (4) resolves to work with the people of the United States 
        to promote the goals and mission established by the Oklahoma 
        City National Memorial on the tenth anniversary of that fateful 
        day;
            (5) supports the resolve for the future, written on the 
        wall of the memorial, ``We come here to remember those who were 
        killed, those who survived, and those changed forever. May all 
        who leave here know the impact of violence. May this memorial 
        offer comfort, strength, peace, hope, and serenity.'';
            (6) designates the week of April 17, 2005, as the National 
        Week of Hope, commemorating the tenth anniversary of the 
        Oklahoma City bombing;
            (7) calls on the people of the United States to participate 
        in the events scheduled for each day of that week to teach a 
        lesson of hope in the midst of political violence and to teach 
        that good endures in the world even among those who commit bad 
        acts and further to teach that there is a way to resolve 
        differences other than resorting to terrorism or violence, 
        including the--
                    (A) Day of Faith;
                    (B) Day of Understanding;
                    (C) Day of Remembrance;
                    (D) Day of Sharing;
                    (E) Day of Tolerance;
                    (F) Day of Caring; and
                    (G) Day of Inspiration;
            (8) congratulates the people of Oklahoma City for making 
        tremendous progress over the past decade and demonstrating 
        their steadfast commitment to the ability of hope to triumph 
        over violence;
            (9) applauds the people of Oklahoma City as they continue 
        to persevere and to stand as a beacon to the rest of the Nation 
        and the world attesting to the strength of goodness in 
        overcoming evil wherever it arises in our midst; and
            (10) directs the Secretary of the Senate to transmit an 
        enrolled copy of this resolution to the Memorial Foundation, as 
        an expression of appreciation.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
