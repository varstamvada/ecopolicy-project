                               RESOLUTION


 
Expressing support for the designation of the month of October 2019, as 
Filipino American History Month and celebrating the history and culture 
  of Filipino Americans and their immense contributions to the United 
                                States.

Whereas the earliest documented Filipino presence in the continental United 
        States was October 18, 1587, when the first ``Luzones Indios'' arrived 
        in Morro Bay, California, on board the Nuestra Senora de Esperanza, a 
        Manila-built galleon ship;
Whereas the Filipino American National Historical Society recognizes 1763 as the 
        year in which the first permanent Filipino settlement in the United 
        States was established in St. Malo, Louisiana;
Whereas the recognition of the first permanent Filipino settlement in the United 
        States adds a new perspective to the history of the United States by 
        bringing attention to the economic, cultural, social, and other notable 
        contributions made by Filipino Americans to the development of our 
        country;
Whereas the Filipino American community is the third-largest Asian-American and 
        Pacific Islander group in the United States, numbering approximately 
        4,000,000;
Whereas from the Civil War to the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts, Filipinos and 
        Filipino Americans have a longstanding history of serving in the United 
        States Armed Forces;
Whereas more than 250,000 Filipinos fought under the United States flag during 
        World War II to protect and defend the United States and the Philippines 
        in the Pacific theater;
Whereas 20,000 Filipino World War II veterans were granted United States 
        citizenship as a result of the Immigration Act of 1990, which was signed 
        into law by President George H.W. Bush on November 29, 1990;
Whereas, on December 14, 2016, President Barack Obama signed into law the 
        Filipino Veterans of World War II Congressional Gold Medal Act of 2015, 
        which awarded Filipino veterans who fought alongside troops of the 
        United States in World War II the highest civilian honor bestowed by 
        Congress;
Whereas, on October 25, 2017, the Congressional Gold Medal was presented to 
        Filipino World War II veterans at Emancipation Hall in the Capitol 
        Building, a recognition for which these veterans have waited more than 
        70 years;
Whereas Filipino Americans continue to demonstrate a commendable sense of 
        patriotism and honor;
Whereas nine Filipino Americans have received the Medal of Honor, the highest 
        award for valor in action against an enemy force that may be bestowed on 
        an individual serving in the Armed Forces;
Whereas the late Peter Aquino Aduja of Hawaii and the late Thelma Garcia 
        Buchholdt of Alaska became the first Filipino American elected to public 
        office and the first Filipina American elected to a legislature in the 
        United States, respectively, inspiring their fellow Filipino Americans 
        to pursue public service in politics and government;
Whereas Filipino American farmworkers and labor leaders, such as Philip Vera 
        Cruz and Larry Itliong, played an integral role in the multiethnic 
        United Farm Workers movement, alongside Cesar Chavez, Dolores Huerta, 
        and other Latino workers;
Whereas Filipino Americans play an integral role in the health care system of 
        the United States as nurses, doctors, and other medical professionals;
Whereas Filipino Americans have contributed greatly to music, dance, literature, 
        education, business, journalism, sports, fashion, politics, government, 
        science, technology, the fine arts, and other fields that enrich the 
        landscape of the United States;
Whereas as mandated in the mission statement of the Filipino American National 
        Historical Society, efforts should continue to promote the study of 
        Filipino American history and culture because the roles of Filipino 
        Americans and other people of color have largely been overlooked in the 
        writing, teaching, and learning of the history of the United States;
Whereas it is imperative for Filipino American youth to have positive role 
        models to instill--

    (1) the significance of education, complemented by the richness of 
Filipino American ethnicity; and

    (2) the value of the Filipino American legacy; and

Whereas it is essential to promote the understanding, education, and 
        appreciation of the history and culture of Filipino Americans in the 
        United States: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports the celebration of Filipino American History 
        Month as--
                    (A) a testament to the long and proud advancement 
                of Filipino Americans;
                    (B) a time to reflect on and remember the many 
                notable contributions that Filipino Americans have made 
                to the United States; and
                    (C) a time to renew efforts toward the research and 
                examination of history and culture so as to provide an 
                opportunity for all people of the United States to 
                learn more about Filipino Americans and to appreciate 
                the historic contributions of Filipino Americans to the 
                United States; and
            (2) encourages the people of the United States to observe 
        Filipino American History Month with appropriate programs and 
        activities.
