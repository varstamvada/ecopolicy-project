  To authorize the Secretary of the Interior to provide technical and 
  financial assistance to private landowners to restore, enhance, and 
 manage private land to improve fish and wildlife habitats through the 
  Partners for Fish and Wildlife Program. &lt;&lt;NOTE: Oct. 3, 2006 -  [S. 
                                 260]&gt;&gt; 

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress &lt;&lt;NOTE: Partners for Fish and 
Wildlife Act.&gt;&gt; assembled,

SECTION 1. &lt;&lt;NOTE: 16 USC 3771 note.&gt;&gt; SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Partners for Fish and Wildlife Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND &lt;&lt;NOTE: 16 USC 3771.&gt;&gt; PURPOSE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) approximately 60 percent of fish and wildlife in the 
        United States are on private land;
            (2) it is imperative to facilitate private landowner-
        centered and results-oriented efforts that promote efficient and 
        innovative ways to protect and enhance natural resources;
            (3) there is no readily available source of technical 
        biological information that the public can access to assist with 
        the application of state-of-the-art techniques to restore, 
        enhance, and manage fish and wildlife habitats;
            (4) a voluntary cost-effective program that leverages public 
        and private funds to assist private landowners in the conduct of 
        state-of-the-art fish and wildlife habitat restoration, 
        enhancement, and management projects is needed;
            (5) durable partnerships working collaboratively with 
        willing private landowners to implement on-the-ground projects 
        has lead to the reduction of endangered species listings;
            (6) Executive Order No. 13352 (69 Fed. Reg. 52989) directs 
        the Departments of the Interior, Agriculture, Commerce, and 
        Defense and the Environmental Protection Agency to pursue new 
        cooperative conservation programs involving the collaboration of 
        Federal, State, local, and tribal governments, private for-
        profit and non-profit institutions, non-governmental entities, 
        and individuals;
            (7) since 1987, the Partners for Fish and Wildlife Program 
        has exemplified cooperative conservation as an innovative, 
        voluntary partnership program that helps private landowners 
        restore wetland and other important fish and wildlife habitat; 
        and
            (8) through 33,103 agreements with private landowners, the 
        Partners for Fish and Wildlife Program has accomplished the 
        restoration of 677,000 acres of wetland, 1,253,700 acres

[[Page 120 STAT. 1352]]

        of prairie and native grasslands, and 5,560 miles of riparian 
        and in-stream habitat since 1987, demonstrating much of that 
        success since only 2001.

    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to provide for the 
restoration, enhancement, and management of fish and wildlife habitats 
on private land through the Partners for Fish and Wildlife Program, a 
program that works with private landowners to conduct cost-effective 
habitat projects for the benefit of fish and wildlife resources in the 
United States.
