                               RESOLUTION


 
    Designating April 23, 2010, as ``National Adopt A Library Day''.

Whereas libraries are an essential part of the communities and the national 
        system of education in the United States;
Whereas the people of the United States benefit significantly from libraries 
        that serve as an open place for people of all ages and backgrounds to 
        make use of books and other resources that offer pathways to learning, 
        self-discovery, and the pursuit of knowledge;
Whereas the libraries of the United States depend on the generous donations and 
        support of individuals and groups to ensure that people who are unable 
        to purchase books still have access to a wide variety of resources;
Whereas certain nonprofit organizations facilitate the donation of books to 
        schools and libraries across the United States--

    (1) to extend the joys of reading to millions of people of the United 
States; and

    (2) to prevent used books from being thrown away;

Whereas, as of the date of agreement to this resolution, the libraries of the 
        United States have provided valuable resources to individuals affected 
        by the economic crisis by encouraging continued education and job 
        training; and
Whereas several States that recognize the importance of libraries and reading 
        have adopted resolutions commemorating April 23 as ``Adopt A Library 
        Day'': Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates April 23, 2010, as ``National Adopt A 
        Library Day'';
            (2) honors the organizations that facilitate donations to 
        schools and libraries;
            (3) urges all people of the United States who own unused 
        books to donate the unused books to local libraries;
            (4) strongly supports children and families who take 
        advantage of the resources provided by schools and libraries; 
        and
            (5) encourages the people of the United States to observe 
        the day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
