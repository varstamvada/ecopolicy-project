                   IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES

_______________________________________________________________________

                               RESOLUTION


 
Designating June 6, 2008, as ``National Huntington's Disease Awareness 
                                 Day''.

Whereas Huntington's Disease is a progressive degenerative neurological disease 
        that causes total physical and mental deterioration over a 12 to 15 year 
        period;
Whereas each child of a parent with Huntington's Disease has a 50 percent chance 
        of inheriting the Huntington's Disease gene;
Whereas Huntington's Disease typically begins in mid-life, between the ages of 
        30 and 45, though onset may occur as early as the age of 2;
Whereas children who develop the juvenile form of the disease rarely live to 
        adulthood;
Whereas the average lifespan after onset of Huntington's Disease is 10 to 20 
        years, and the younger the age of onset, the more rapid the progression 
        of the disease;
Whereas Huntington's Disease affects 30,000 patients and 200,000 genetically 
        ``at risk'' individuals in the United States;
Whereas, since the discovery of the gene that causes Huntington's Disease in 
        1993, the pace of Huntington's Disease research has accelerated;
Whereas, although no effective treatment or cure currently exists, scientists 
        and researchers are hopeful that breakthroughs will be forthcoming;
Whereas researchers across the Nation are conducting important research projects 
        involving Huntington's Disease; and
Whereas the Senate is an institution that can raise awareness in the general 
        public and the medical community of Huntington's Disease: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates June 6, 2008, as ``National Huntington's 
        Disease Awareness Day'';
            (2) recognizes that all people of the United States should 
        become more informed and aware of Huntington's Disease; and
            (3) respectfully requests the Secretary of the Senate to 
        transmit a copy of this resolution to the Huntington's Disease 
        Society of America.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
