                               RESOLUTION


 
 Recognizing the significance of Asian/Pacific American Heritage Month 
in May as an important time to celebrate the significant contributions 
 of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders to the history of the United 
                                States.

Whereas the people of the United States join together each May to pay tribute to 
        the contributions of generations of Asian Americans and Pacific 
        Islanders who have enriched the history of the United States;
Whereas the history of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders in the United 
        States is inextricably tied to the story of the United States;
Whereas the Asian-American and Pacific Islander community is an inherently 
        diverse population, comprised of over 45 distinct ethnicities and over 
        100 language dialects;
Whereas according to the United States Census Bureau, the Asian-American 
        population grew faster than any other racial or ethnic group over the 
        last decade, surging nearly 72 percent between 2000 and 2015;
Whereas there are approximately 22,600,000 residents of the United States who 
        identify themselves as Asian and approximately 1,600,000 residents of 
        the United States who identify themselves as Native Hawaiian or Pacific 
        Islander, making up over 7 percent of the total United States 
        population;
Whereas the month of May was selected for Asian/Pacific American Heritage Month 
        because the first Japanese immigrants arrived in the United States on 
        May 7, 1843, and the first transcontinental railroad was completed on 
        May 10, 1869, with substantial contributions from Chinese immigrants;
Whereas section 102 of title 36, United States Code, officially designates May 
        as Asian/Pacific American Heritage Month and requests the President to 
        issue an annual proclamation calling on the people of the United States 
        to observe the month with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and 
        activities;
Whereas 2020 marks several important milestones for the Asian-American and 
        Pacific Islander community, including--

    (1) the 30th anniversary of the enactment of Public Law 101-283 
designating May as Asian/Pacific American Heritage Month;

    (2) the 35th anniversary of the mission aboard the Space Shuttle 
Discovery of Ellison Shoji Onizuka, the first Asian American in space;

    (3) the 45th anniversary of the end of the Vietnam War and the 
beginning of the Southeast Asian diaspora to communities across the United 
States;

    (4) the 45th anniversary of the completion of the double-hulled 
voyaging canoe, Hokulea, marking the first traditional Polynesian voyaging 
canoe built in Hawaii in more than 600 years;

    (5) the 55th anniversary of the enactment of the Act entitled ``An Act 
to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act, and for other purposes'', 
approved October 3, 1965 (79 Stat. 911), landmark legislation that reversed 
restrictive immigration policies against immigrants from Asia; and

    (6) the 110th anniversary of the establishment of Angel Island 
Immigration Station in San Francisco Bay, California, which served as a 
major port of entry for immigrants coming to the United States from Asia 
and the Pacific;

Whereas Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders have made significant 
        contributions to the United States at all levels of the Federal 
        Government and the United States Armed Forces, including--

    (1) Daniel K. Inouye, a Medal of Honor and Presidential Medal of 
Freedom recipient who, as President Pro Tempore of the Senate, was the 
highest-ranking Asian-American government official in the history of the 
United States;

    (2) Dalip Singh Saund, the first Asian-American Congressman;

    (3) Patsy T. Mink, the first woman of color and Asian-American woman to 
be elected to Congress;

    (4) Hiram L. Fong, the first Asian-American Senator;

    (5) Daniel K. Akaka, the first Senator of Native Hawaiian ancestry;

    (6) Norman Y. Mineta, the first Asian-American member of a Presidential 
Cabinet; and

    (7) Elaine L. Chao, the first Asian-American woman member of a 
Presidential Cabinet;

Whereas in 2020, the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, a bicameral 
        caucus of Members of Congress advocating on behalf of Asian Americans 
        and Pacific Islanders, is composed of 76 Members, including 20 Members 
        of Asian or Pacific Islander descent;
Whereas in 2020, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders are serving in State and 
        Territorial legislatures across the United States in record numbers, 
        including in--

    (1) the States of Alaska, Arizona, California, Connecticut, Georgia, 
Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, 
Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nevada, New Hampshire, New 
Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, 
Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington, and Wyoming; and

    (2) the Territories of American Samoa, Guam, and the Commonwealth of 
the Northern Mariana Islands;

Whereas in 2020, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders honorably serve at all 
        levels of the Federal judiciary;
Whereas Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders have been disproportionately 
        impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, with Native Hawaiians and Pacific 
        Islanders facing among the highest infection and mortality rates out of 
        any racial group in the States of California, Washington, Oregon, 
        Nevada, Colorado, and Arkansas;
Whereas there are over 2 million Asian-American and Pacific Islander first 
        responders, health care providers, and frontline workers who are among 
        the unsung heroes in the Nation's fight against COVID-19;
Whereas since January 2020, there has been a dramatic increase in reports of 
        anti-Asian hate crimes and incidents related to the COVID-19 pandemic, 
        with over 2,000 incidents reported in recent months;
Whereas there remains much to be done to ensure that Asian Americans and Pacific 
        Islanders have access to resources and a voice in the Government of the 
        United States and continue to advance in the political landscape of the 
        United States; and
Whereas celebrating Asian/Pacific American Heritage Month provides the people of 
        the United States with an opportunity to recognize the achievements, 
        contributions, and history of, and to understand the challenges faced 
        by, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) recognizes the significance of Asian/Pacific American 
        Heritage Month as an important time to celebrate the 
        significant contributions of Asian Americans and Pacific 
        Islanders to the history of the United States; and
            (2) recognizes that Asian-American and Pacific Islander 
        communities enhance the rich diversity of and strengthen the 
        United States.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
