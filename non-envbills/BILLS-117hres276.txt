Recognizing the heritage, culture, and contributions of Latinas in the 
                             United States.

Whereas the United States celebrates National Women's History Month every March 
        to recognize and honor the achievements of women throughout the history 
        of the United States;
Whereas there are nearly 29,000,000 Latinas living in the United States;
Whereas 1 in 6 women in the United States is a Latina;
Whereas Latinas have helped shape the history of the United States since its 
        inception;
Whereas Latinas contribute to the society of the United States through working 
        in many industries, including business, education, science and 
        technology, medicine, engineering, mathematics, literature and the arts, 
        the military, agriculture, hospitality, and public service;
Whereas Latinas serve as essential workers during the COVID-19 pandemic, filling 
        vital positions that keep the economy going and the people of the United 
        States safe;
Whereas Latinas come from diverse cultures across North America, Central 
        America, South America, and the Caribbean, and Afro-Latinas face 
        disparities in recognition;
Whereas Latinas are dedicated public servants, holding posts at the highest 
        levels of the Federal Government, including the Supreme Court of the 
        United States, the Cabinet-level positions, the United States Senate, 
        and the United States House of Representatives;
Whereas Latinas make up an estimated 19 percent of women serving in the Armed 
        Forces, and the first Latina to become a general in the Marine Corps 
        reached that rank in 2006;
Whereas Latinas are breaking the glass ceiling in science, technology, 
        engineering, and mathematics, with the first Latina to travel into space 
        doing so during a 9-day Space Shuttle Discovery mission in 1993;
Whereas Latinas own more than 2,000,000 businesses and 18 percent of all women-
        owned companies in the United States are owned by a Latina;
Whereas Latina activists have led the fight for civil rights, including labor 
        rights, LGBTQ rights, women's rights, and racial equality;
Whereas Latinas create award-winning art and are recipients of Emmy, Grammy, 
        Oscar, and Tony awards;
Whereas Latina singers and songwriters, like Selena, also known as the Queen of 
        Tejano music, and Celia Cruz, also known as the Queen of Salsa, have 
        made lasting and significant contributions to music throughout the 
        world;
Whereas Latinas serve in the medical profession, and the first female and first 
        Hispanic Surgeon General of the United States was appointed in 1990;
Whereas Latinas serve as journalists, reporting vital news and information to 
        the public;
Whereas Latinas are world-class athletes, representing the United States in the 
        Olympics and other international competitions;
Whereas Latinas are paid just 55 cents for every dollar paid to White, non-
        Hispanic men;
Whereas in the face of societal obstacles, including unequal pay, disparities in 
        education, health care needs, and civil rights struggles, Latinas 
        continue to break through and thrive;
Whereas the United States should continue to invest in the future of Latinas to 
        address the barriers they face; and
Whereas, by 2060, Latinas will represent one-fourth of the female population of 
        the United States: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) celebrates and honors the successes of Latinas and the 
        contributions they have made and continue to make to the United 
        States; and
            (2) recognizes the changes that are still to be made to 
        ensure that Latinas can realize their full potential as equal 
        members of society.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
