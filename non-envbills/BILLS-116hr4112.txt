                                 A BILL


 
To designate Haiti under section 244 of the Immigration and Nationality 
Act to permit nationals of Haiti to be eligible for temporary protected 
  status under such section during and after the pendency of certain 
                  litigation, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) On January 12, 2010, Haiti was hit by a magnitude 7.0 
        earthquake.
            (2) Approximately 3,000,000 people were affected by the 
        earthquake, with an estimated 250,000 people losing their lives 
        and 300,000 people suffering injuries.
            (3) On January 21, 2010, the United States designated Haiti 
        for temporary protected status.
            (4) The continued designation of temporary protected status 
        for Haiti would preserve the per annum estimated $1,000,000,000 
        in remittances sent to Haiti from Haitians in the United 
        States.
            (5) These remittances exceed the amount of foreign 
        assistance given to Haiti by the United States and are crucial 
        to Haiti's recovery.
            (6) On October 20, 2010, an outbreak of cholera was 
        confirmed for the first time in over 100 years.
            (7) Haiti continues to work to recover from the devastating 
        cholera outbreak.
            (8) The cholera outbreak is estimated to have killed over 
        an estimated 9,000 people and infected nearly 800,000 Haitians.
            (9) On October 4, 2016, Hurricane Matthew struck Haiti.
            (10) Hurricane Matthew resulted in the damage of 
        approximately 45 percent of Haiti's southwest piped water 
        supply.
            (11) Hurricane Matthew resulted in crop losses estimated to 
        be $360,000,000.
            (12) Hurricane Matthew is estimated to have killed over 
        1,000 people and directly affected 2.1 million Haitians.
            (13) Hurricane Matthew was responsible for the internal 
        displacement of 175,000 people and left 1.4 million Haitians in 
        need of urgent humanitarian aid.
            (14) Hurricane Matthew is estimated to have resulted in 
        damages assessed at $1,000,000,000, or roughly 11.4 percent of 
        Haiti's gross domestic product.

SEC. 2. DESIGNATION OF HAITI FOR PURPOSES OF GRANTING TEMPORARY 
              PROTECTED STATUS.

    For purposes of section 244 of the Immigration and Nationality Act 
(8 U.S.C. 1254a), Haiti shall be treated as if it had been designated

            (1) for a period of 8 months every 3 months during the 
        period beginning on the date of the enactment of this Act and 
        ending on the date on which a final decision is rendered in 
        both--
                    (A) Ramos v. Nielsen (Northern District, CA; Case 
                No. 18-cv-01554); and
                    (B) Saget v. Trump (Eastern District, NY; Case No. 
                1:18-cv-01599); and
            (2) for the 18-month period beginning on the last day of 
        the last 8-month period under paragraph (1).
                                 &lt;all&gt;
