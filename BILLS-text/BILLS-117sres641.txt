        represent Federal, State, and local governments and private sector 
        organizations throughout the United States;
Whereas public works professionals design, build, operate, and maintain the 
        transportation systems, water infrastructure, sewage and refuse disposal 
        systems, public buildings, sanitation and waste management systems, and 
        other structures and facilities that are vital to the people and 
        communities of the United States;
Whereas public works professionals have played, and will continue to play, a key 
        role in helping the United States recover from the COVID-19 pandemic; 
        and
Whereas understanding the role that public infrastructure plays in protecting 
        the environment, improving public health and safety, contributing to 
        economic vitality, and enhancing the quality of life of every community 
        of the United States is in the interest of the people of the United 
        States: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates the week of May 15 through May 21, 2022, as 
        ``National Public Works Week'';

                    (B) the communities that public works professionals 
                serve; and
            (3) urges individuals and communities throughout the United 
        States to join with representatives of the Federal Government 
        and the American Public Works Association in activities and 
        ceremonies that are designed--

                professionals of the United States; and
                    (B) to recognize the substantial contributions that 
                public works professionals make to the United States.
