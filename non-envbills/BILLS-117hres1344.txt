 Supporting the idea of celebrating the 50th year of the Walnut Valley 
                               Festival.

Whereas Bob and Kendra Redford founded the Walnut Valley Festival in the Fourth 
        District of Kansas back in 1972;
Whereas Bob Redford served more than 40 years as its president until his passing 
        in December 2016;
Whereas Bob and Kendra Redford's son Bart is the Executive Director of the 
        Walnut Valley Festival;
Whereas Bob and Kendra Redford's dedication to live music resulted in this 
        legendary event, which is one of the longest running music festivals in 
        United States history, and for 50 years, pickers and music lovers have 
        journeyed to this special place on the Kansas plains to celebrate life 
        with music;
Whereas Bob and Kendra Redford have given so much to the community in Cowley 
        County, Kansas, and dedicated years of service to leading and promoting 
        this iconic festival that has become known as Pickers Paradise;
Whereas the Walnut Valley Festival is home to the National Flat Pick 
        Championships, the International Finger Style Championships, and the 
        International Autoharp, National Mandolin, National Mountain Dulcimer, 
        National Hammered Dulcimer, National Bluegrass Banjo, and Walnut Valley 
        Old Time Fiddle Championships;
Whereas Bob Redford's legacy lives in the community of musicians and music 
        lovers from around the world, who will gather the third weekend in 
        September in the pecan grove along the Walnut River in Winfield, Kansas, 
        for the 50th Annual Walnut Valley Festival, where thousands return year 
        after year to experience outstanding live music in the grandstands, 
        performed by world famous musicians, along with legendary campground 
        jams; and
Whereas the Walnut Valley Festival has long prided itself on being educational 
        as well as enjoyable, but most of all, the Festival is a homecoming not 
        just because of the music and community, but coming home to a place in 
        the soul and the heart with a spirit of celebration: Now, therefore, be 
        it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives supports the idea of 
celebrating the 50th year of the Walnut Valley Festival.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
