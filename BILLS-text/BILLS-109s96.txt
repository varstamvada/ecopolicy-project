                                 A BILL


 
   To target Federal funding for research and development, to amend 
section 1928 of the Social Security Act to encourage the production of 
   influenza vaccines by eliminating the price cap applicable to the 
purchase of such vaccines under contracts entered into by the Secretary 
  of Health and Human Services, to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 
    1986 to establish a tax credit to encourage vaccine production 
                   capacity, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Flu Vaccine Incentive Act of 2005'' 
or the ``FLU-VIA''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) 30 years ago, more than a dozen companies produced the 
        influenza vaccine in the United States. As of 2004, only 2 
        companies make the vaccine for the United States.
            (2) Currently, the influenza vaccine is grown in eggs 
        through a process that takes approximately 6 months and 
        consumes tens of thousands of eggs.
            (3) Companies are developing new technologies for the 
        faster and safer production of the influenza vaccine. For 
        example, one manufacturer is testing a process that relies on 
        cell lines from silk moths, a technique that promises to shave 
        the production time by at least a month and reduce the costs 
        significantly.
            (4) The United States should do all that it can to 
        encourage research and development of new technologies for the 
        production of influenza vaccines.

SEC. 3. TARGETING APPROPRIATED FUNDS FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT.

    Effective as if included in the enactment of the Consolidated 
Appropriations Act, 2005 (Public Law 108-447), under the heading 
relating to ``Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund'' under 
title II of division F, strike ``, and if determined necessary by the 
Secretary, the purchase of influenza vaccine,''.

SEC. 4. ELIMINATION OF PRICE CAP FOR THE PURCHASE OF INFLUENZA 
              VACCINES.

                other contracts entered into by the Secretary for the 
                purchase of an influenza vaccine, the price for the 
                purchase of such vaccine shall be established without 
                regard to subparagraph (B).''.
            (2) Effective date.--The amendments made by paragraph (1) 
        shall apply to contracts entered into on or after the date of 
        enactment of this Act.

1928(d)(3)(D) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396s(d)(3)(D)), as
