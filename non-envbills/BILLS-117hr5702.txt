                                 A BILL


 
To prohibit Federal agencies from granting a work authorization to any 
    alien for the purpose of replacing unvaccinated U.S. healthcare 
                    workers, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Preventing the Loss of American Jobs 
due to Unjust Mandates Act''.

SEC. 2. PROHIBITION ON CERTAIN WORK AUTHORIZATIONS.

    Effective beginning on the date of the enactment of this Act, all 
Federal agencies are prohibited from granting a work authorization to 
an alien for the purpose of effectively replacing any unvaccinated U.S. 
healthcare worker terminated from their position as a result of a 
local, State, or Federal vaccine mandate.

SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

     It is the sense of Congress that any attempt by a local, State, or 
Federal official to terminate the employment of U.S. healthcare workers 
due to a refusal to receive a COVID-19 vaccine is both morally 
repugnant and unconstitutional.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
