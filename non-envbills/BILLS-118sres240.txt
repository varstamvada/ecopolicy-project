                   IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES

                              June 7, 2023

 Mr. Cassidy (for himself and Mrs. Feinstein) submitted the following 
             resolution; which was considered and agreed to

_______________________________________________________________________

                               RESOLUTION


 
 Designating June 8, 2023, as ``National Seersucker Day'', designating 
every Thursday after National Seersucker Day through the last Thursday 
in August 2023 as ``Seersucker Thursday'', and designating June 2023 as 
                   ``Seersucker Appreciation Month''.

Whereas seersucker was introduced to the United States in the South in the 
        middle of the 19th century;
Whereas seersucker suits were popularized in the United States in the early 
        1900s by New Orleans businessman Joseph Haspel at his Broad Street 
        facility in New Orleans, Louisiana;
Whereas, as a lightweight, hard-wearing fabric, seersucker is mostly worn and 
        enjoyed by the people of the United States during hot summer months;
Whereas former Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi brought Seersucker Thursday to 
        Congress in 1996, and after the day went unobserved in 2012 and 2013, 
        then-Representative Bill Cassidy revived the tradition in the House of 
        Representatives in 2014 and, with the help of Senator Dianne Feinstein, 
        has continued the tradition ever since;
Whereas the name ``seersucker'' originates from the Persian phrase ``shir-o-
        shakar'', meaning ``milk and sugar'', alluding to the alternating 
        textures of the fabric;
Whereas the seersucker textile is made of cotton, linen, or silk (or 
        combinations thereof), woven on a loom with threads at different 
        tensions, creating alternating stripes of smooth and puckered textures 
        that do not lay flat on one's skin, which is what makes the fabric so 
        breathable; and
Whereas one of the two alternating stripes in seersucker is frequently in a 
        color, typically blue, but sometimes gray, green, tan, red, pink, or 
        another color, which, in combination with the white stripes, creates the 
        iconic pattern so well known today: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates June 8, 2023, as National Seersucker Day;
            (2) designates every Thursday after National Seersucker Day 
        through the last Thursday in August 2023 as ``Seersucker 
        Thursday'';
            (3) designates June 2023 as ``Seersucker Appreciation 
        Month'';
            (4) recognizes the contributions of the hard-working people 
        of the United States through the wearing of seersucker, the 
        unique warm weather clothing known as the working person's 
        uniform;
            (5) encourages Senators to support the objective of 
        National Seersucker Day and Seersucker Thursday;
            (6) encourages local governments in the United States to 
        build partnerships with local organizations and other members 
        of the clothing industries and enthusiasts to promote the 
        wearing of seersucker; and
            (7) invites the people of the United States to don their 
        warm weather finest on National Seersucker Day and every 
        Seersucker Thursday.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
