To amend title 4, United States Code, to prescribe that members of the 
Armed Forces and veterans out of uniform may render the military salute 
             during hoisting, lowering, or passing of flag.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. CONDUCT BY MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES AND VETERANS OUT OF 
              UNIFORM DURING HOISTING, LOWERING, OR PASSING OF FLAG.

    Section 9 of title 4, United States Code, is amended by striking 
``all persons present'' and all that follows through the end and 
inserting ``those present in uniform should render the military salute. 
Members of the Armed Forces and veterans who are present but not in 
uniform may render the military salute. All other persons present 
should face the flag and stand at attention with their right hand over 
the heart, or if applicable, remove their headdress with their right 
hand and hold it at the left shoulder, the hand being over the heart. 
Citizens of other countries should stand at attention. All such conduct 
toward the flag in a moving column should be rendered at the moment the 
flag passes.''.

            Passed the Senate July 25, 2007.

            Attest:

                                                             Secretary.
