        exercise;
            (2) support heart health promotion activities of community 
        organizations that work with or serve communities 
        disproportionately affected by heart disease, such as South 
        Asian communities in the United States;
            (3) support, with respect to research conducted relating to 
        heart disease, conferences and workshops on how practices, 
        methodologies, and designs of such research should be changed 
        to include in such research more members of communities 
        disproportionately affected by heart disease, such as South 
        Asian communities in the United States; or
            (4) conduct or support research and related activities 
        regarding cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and other 
        heart health-related ailments among at-risk populations, 
        including South Asian communities in the United States.
    (c) Report to Congress.--Not later than 2 years after the date of 
enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall

Representatives a report on activities supported under subsection (a) 
and data relating to heart disease in communities disproportionately 
affected by heart disease.
    (d) Authorization of Appropriations.--For purposes of carrying out 
this section, there is authorized to be appropriated $2,000,000 for 
each of fiscal years 2024 through 2028.
