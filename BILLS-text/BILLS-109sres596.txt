   Appreciation Day'' to honor and celebrate the firefighters of the

Whereas there are more than 1,100,000 firefighters in the United States;

        volunteers who receive little or no compensation for their heroic work;
Whereas there are more than 30,000 fire departments in the United States;
Whereas thousands of firefighters have died in the line of duty since the date 
        that Benjamin Franklin founded the first volunteer fire department in 
        1735;
Whereas 346 firefighters and emergency personnel died while responding to the 
        terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001;
Whereas firefighters respond to more than 20,000,000 calls during a typical 
        year;
Whereas firefighters also provide emergency medical services, hazardous 
        materials response, special rescue response, terrorism response, and 
        life safety education;
Whereas, in 1922, President Harding declared the week of October 9 to be ``Fire 
        Prevention Week''; and
Whereas the second Tuesday in October is an appropriate day for the 
        establishment of a ``National Firefighter Appreciation Day'': Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate designates Tuesday, October 10, 2006, as 
``National Firefighter Appreciation Day'' to honor and celebrate the 
firefighters of the United States.
