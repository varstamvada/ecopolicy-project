 Commending the members of the 45th Agri-Business Development Team of 
the Oklahoma National Guard, for their efforts to modernize agriculture 
 and sustainable farming practices in Afghanistan and their dedication 
                   and service to the United States.

Whereas members of the 1-45th Agri-Business Development Team (ADT) took control 
        of the ADT mission in the Paktya and Paktika provinces of eastern 
        Afghanistan from the 1-16th ADT from the Tennessee National Guard on 
        December 21, 2009, and members of the 2-45th ADT are planned to take 
        over their mission in the summer of 2010;
Whereas the members of the ADT of the Oklahoma National Guard are experts in 
        civilian agriculture practices and will provide important resources to 
        the Afghan population in fostering sustainable agriculture practices, 
        improving food production and processing, providing secure storage 
        facilities and controlled temperature facilities, and ensuring secure 
        and legal economic growth;
Whereas the International Agricultural Program at Oklahoma State University in 
        Stillwater, Oklahoma, has provided valuable training for the 45th ADT 
        pre-deployment and has provided a valuable educational research tool for 
        Guardsmen and women deployed to Afghanistan;
Whereas agriculture accounts for 45 percent of the gross domestic product of 
        Afghanistan and over 80 percent of the population of Afghanistan is 
        engaged in farming and agriculture;
Whereas the 45th ADT works closely with the Provincial Director of Agriculture 
        in Afghanistan to ensure farmers and ranchers in Afghanistan are 
        receiving valuable assistance in rebuilding and restoring the 
        agricultural economy of Afghanistan; and
Whereas the ADTs partner with the United States Department of Agriculture and 
        the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) to 
        provide interagency support to farmers in Afghanistan and are critical 
        to the overall success to the mission in Afghanistan: Now, therefore, be 
        it
    Resolved, That the Senate commends the members of the 45th Agri-
Business Development Team of the Oklahoma National Guard, for--
            (1) their efforts to modernize agriculture and sustainable 
        farming practices in Afghanistan; and
            (2) their dedication and service to the United States.
