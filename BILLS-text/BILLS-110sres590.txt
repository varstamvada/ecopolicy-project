                               RESOLUTION


 
 Celebrating the 233rd birthday of the Army and commending the men and 
   women of the Army as exceptional individuals who live by the Army 
 values of loyalty, duty, respect, selfless service, honor, integrity, 
                         and personal courage.

Whereas, from the first Continental Army under General Washington at Yorktown to 
        the beaches of Normandy, the city streets of Iraq, and the mountains of 
        Afghanistan, the Army has protected and kept the flame of democracy 
        burning brightly;
Whereas the citizens of the United States continue to enjoy the benefits of 
        freedom and democracy because the men and women of the Army have stood 
        through adversity, remained steadfast in the most difficult of 
        circumstances, and bravely fought against the enemies of peace 
        throughout the world;
Whereas the sacrifices of the men and women of the Army inspire and instill 
        great pride in all citizens of the United States;
Whereas the active duty, National Guard, and Reserve components of the Army 
        protect the Nation from our enemies, defend our vital national 
        interests, provide support to civil authorities in response to domestic 
        emergencies, provide ready forces and land force capabilities to the 
        Combatant Commanders in support of the National Security Strategy, and 
        support operations around the world, ranging from peace-time military 
        engagements to major combat operations;
Whereas the Army is successfully performing operations, other than combat 
        operations, including--

    (1) supporting the defense of South Korea, Japan, and many other 
friends, allies, and partners of the United States;

    (2) conducting peacekeeping operations in the Sinai Peninsula and the 
Balkans;

    (3) conducting multinational exercises that reflect our longstanding 
commitments to alliances;

    (4) continuing engagements with foreign militaries to build 
partnerships and preserve coalitions by training and advising their 
military forces;

    (5) participating, most notably by the Army National Guard, in securing 
the borders of the United States and conducting operations to counter the 
flow of illegal drugs;

    (6) supporting civil authorities in responding to domestic emergencies, 
including natural disasters and threats at home and abroad;

    (7) supporting interagency and multinational partnerships with 
technical expertise, providing critical support after natural disasters, 
and promoting regional stability; and

    (8) supporting operations to protect against weapons of mass 
destruction and block their proliferation;

Whereas the accomplishments of the Army are attributable to the men and women of 
        the Army who have demonstrated courage, strength, and versatility and 
        endured countless hardships and made great sacrifices in performing 
        diverse missions worldwide;
Whereas the contributions of Army families should also be recognized, as Army 
        families provide the cornerstone of strength and support for the 
        Nation's Soldiers and display tremendous commitment and sacrifice to the 
        Nation by providing critical support to their loved ones during 
        prolonged absences;
Whereas the Army has been continuously engaged in persistent combat operations 
        for more than 6 years, has constantly and successfully adapted to ever-
        changing security environments, has displayed courage, resourcefulness, 
        and resilience in the most grueling conditions, and, while focused on 
        preparing forces and building readiness for counterinsurgency operations 
        and providing stability, security, and hope to the peoples of Iraq and 
        Afghanistan, has taken significant steps toward restoring balance to the 
        all-volunteer, battle-hardened force; and
Whereas those and countless other great accomplishments add to the longstanding 
        tradition of the Army and attest to the extraordinary capability of the 
        men and women who serve the United States in the Army: Now, therefore, 
        be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) celebrates the 233rd birthday of the Army;
            (2) salutes the men and women of the Army and their 
        families;
            (3) commends the men and women of the Army as exceptional 
        individuals who live by the Army values of loyalty, duty, 
        respect, selfless service, honor, integrity, and personal 
        courage; and
            (4) recognizes that the great men and women of the Army are 
        the reason it continues to stand as the best army in the world 
        and continues to perform extraordinary tasks while upholding 
        its hallowed traditions.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
