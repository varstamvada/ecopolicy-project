                               RESOLUTION


 
Urging the people of the United States to observe the month of October 
          2023 as Italian and Italian-American Heritage Month.

Whereas Italian and Italian-American Heritage Month is an appropriate time to 
        recognize the enormous contributions the Italian and Italian-American 
        people have made to this country and the world throughout our history, 
        including generals, admirals, doctors, philosophers, statesmen, 
        musicians, athletes, and Nobel laureates;
Whereas Italian and Italian-American Heritage Month is held to salute the 
        Italian and Italian-American community and to exhibit appreciation for 
        their culture and their heritage that have immeasurably enriched the 
        lives of the people of this Nation and the world;
Whereas the strength and success of the United States, the vitality of our 
        communities, and the effectiveness of our American society depend, in 
        great measure, upon the distinctive and sterling qualities demonstrated 
        by people of diverse races, heritages, and ethnicities, exemplified by 
        members of the Italian and Italian-American community, who share with us 
        their rich and unique heritage; and
Whereas it is fitting and proper that October 2023 be observed as Italian and 
        Italian-American Heritage Month throughout the United States: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That in order to recognize the enormous contributions 
Italian and Italian-American people have made to this country and the 
world throughout our history, the House of Representatives urges the 
people of the United States to acknowledge Italian and Italian-American 
Heritage Month and to observe the month with appropriate events and 
activities.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
