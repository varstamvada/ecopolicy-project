                               RESOLUTION


 
 Celebrating the 231st birthday of the Army and commending the men and 
women of the Army as exceptional individuals who live by the values of 
                  loyalty, duty, and selfless service.

Whereas, from the first Continental Army under General Washington to the beaches 
        of Normandy and the city streets of Iraq, the Army has protected the 
        flame of democracy;
Whereas the citizens of the United States continue to enjoy freedom and spread 
        the light of democracy because the men and women of the Army have stood 
        through adversity, remained steadfast in the most difficult of 
        circumstances, and bravely fought against the enemies of peace 
        throughout the world;
Whereas the sacrifices of those men and women of the Army have called all 
        citizens of the United States, both public and private, to the highest 
        forms of citizenship;
Whereas the Army maintains its presence in 120 countries across the world, 
        including Saudi Arabia, Korea, and Kosovo;
Whereas the accomplishments of the Army in the Global War on Terror have 
        demonstrated the courage and strength of the men and women of the Army;
Whereas, in Iraq, the Army has brought freedom to a population once under 
        tyrannical control, allowing the citizens of Iraq to enjoy the recent 
        election of officials, the formation of a constitution, and the 
        formation of the government under Prime Minister al-Maliki;
Whereas the men and women of the Army continued to provide stability and 
        security to Iraqis by killing Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, who was commonly 
        known among terrorists as the ``prince of al-Qaeda'';
Whereas Iraq has become a better place and a great ally, which was evident when 
        the ambassador of Iraq presented his credentials to the Secretary of 
        State for the first time in 15 years; and
Whereas those great accomplishments add to the longstanding tradition of the 
        Army and attest to the extraordinary capability of the men and women who 
        serve the United States: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) salutes the men and women of the Army;
            (2) commends the men and women of the Army as exceptional 
        individuals who live by the values of loyalty, duty, and 
        selfless service; and
            (3) recognizes that those great citizens--
                    (A) are the reason why the Army continues to stand 
                as the best military force in the world; and
                    (B) continue to perform amazing tasks and uphold 
                the honored traditions of the Army by adhering to the 
                principle expressed by General Douglas MacArthur when 
                he proudly declared that ``Americans never quit.''.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
