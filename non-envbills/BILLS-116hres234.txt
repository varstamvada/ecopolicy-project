                               RESOLUTION


 
Recognizing the heritage, culture, and contributions of Latinas in the 
                             United States.

Whereas the United States celebrates National Women's History Month every March 
        to recognize and honor the achievements of women throughout the history 
        of the United States;
Whereas there are nearly 28,000,000 Latinas living in the United States;
Whereas 1 in 6 women in the United States is a Latina;
Whereas Latinas have helped shape the history of the United States since its 
        inception;
Whereas Latinas contribute to the society of the United States through working 
        in many industries, including business, education, science and 
        technology, medicine, engineering, mathematics, literature and the arts, 
        the military, agriculture, hospitality, and public service at every 
        level of government;
Whereas Latinas come from diverse cultures across North America, Central 
        America, South America, and the Caribbean, and Afro-Latinas face 
        disparities in recognition;
Whereas Latinas are dedicated public servants, holding posts at the highest 
        levels of the Federal Government, including the Supreme Court, the 
        Cabinet, the Senate, and the House of Representatives;
Whereas Latinas make up an estimated 16 percent of women in the Armed Forces, 
        and in 2006, the first Latina became a general in the United States 
        Marine Corps;
Whereas Latinas are breaking the glass ceiling in the science, technology, 
        engineering, and mathematics fields, and in 1993 the first Latina went 
        into space during a 9-day Space Shuttle Discovery mission;
Whereas Latinas own nearly 2,000,000 businesses and 1 in 6 women-owned companies 
        in the United States is owned by a Latina;
Whereas Latina activists have led the fight for civil rights, including labor 
        rights, LGBTQ rights, women's rights, and racial equality;
Whereas Latinas create award-winning art and are recipients of Emmy, Grammy, 
        Oscar, and Tony awards;
Whereas Latina singers and songwriters, like Selena, also known as the Queen of 
        Tejano music, and Celia Cruz, also known as the Queen of Salsa, have 
        made lasting and significant contributions to music throughout the 
        world;
Whereas Latinas serve in the medical profession, and in 1990, the first female 
        and first Hispanic Surgeon General of the United States was appointed;
Whereas Latinas are paid just 53 cents for every dollar paid to White, non-
        Hispanic men;
Whereas in the face of societal obstacles, including unequal pay, disparities in 
        education, health care needs, and civil rights struggles, Latinas 
        continue to break through and thrive;
Whereas the United States should continue to invest in the future of Latinas to 
        address the barriers they face; and
Whereas, by 2060, Latinas will represent one-third of the female population of 
        the United States: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) celebrates and honors the successes of Latinas and the 
        contributions they have made and continue to make to the United 
        States; and
            (2) recognizes the changes that are still to be made to 
        ensure that Latinas can realize their full potential as equal 
        members of society.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
