        paragraph (1) demonstrates to the Secretary that the intended 
        use of the project for which assistance was provided under this 
        Act no longer represents the best use of the property used for 
        the project, the Secretary may approve a request by the 
        recipient to convert the property to a different use for the 
        remainder of the term of the Federal interest in the property,
