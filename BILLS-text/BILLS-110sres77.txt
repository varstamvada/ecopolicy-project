                   IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES

                           February 12, 2007

  Mr. Inhofe (for himself and Mr. Brownback) submitted the following 
  resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations

_______________________________________________________________________

                               RESOLUTION


 
   Expressing support for the Transitional Federal Government of the 
                            Somali Republic.

Whereas, after the collapse of the Somali government in 1991, the main judicial 
        system in Somalia devolved into a system of sharia-based Islamic courts, 
        which have increased their power to include security and enforcement 
        functions;
Whereas, in 2000, the courts consolidated to form the Islamic Courts Union 
        (ICU), which came into conflict with secular warlords in the capitol 
        city of Mogadishu by asserting its ever increasing power;
Whereas the ICU is known to have links to Al-Qaeda and has provided a safe haven 
        for members of Al-Qaeda;
Whereas, by June 2006, ICU forces controlled Mogadishu and much of southern 
        Somalia, creating a potential haven for Islamic terrorists;
Whereas, in 2004, the Transitional Federal Government of the Somali Republic 
        (TFG) was formed in Kenya;
Whereas, in 2006, the TFG army joined forces with the army of the Federal 
        Democratic Republic of Ethiopia to sweep the ICU from power and, after a 
        string of swift military victories, enter Mogadishu; and
Whereas the current situation is still volatile, creating a short window of 
        opportunity to positively affect Somalia's stability and future status:
Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--
            (1) the Senate expresses its support for the Transitional 
        Federal Government of the Somali Republic;
            (2) the Senate recognizes Ethiopia, particularly Prime 
        Minister Meles, and Kenya for the noble efforts aimed toward 
        pursuing peace in Somalia and support for the United States in 
        the War on Terror;
            (3) the United States should support and push efforts for 
        serious multi-party talks aimed at establishing a national 
        unity government in Somalia;
            (4) the United States should take several measures, at an 
        appropriate time, to promote stability;
            (5) assistance from the United States will better equip the 
        TFG to face the challenges of restoring peace to this war-torn 
        country;
            (6) the United States should promote foreign investment in 
        Somalia and facilitate financial and technical assistance to 
        the TFG; and
            (7) the United States should aid the TFG to--
                    (A) locate and free Somali-owned financial assets 
                throughout the world;
                    (B) solicit support from other friendly countries; 
                and
                    (C) encourage nongovernmental organizations to 
                commit more resources and projects to Somalia.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
