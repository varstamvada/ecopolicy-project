                    (C) by redesignating clause (iv) as clause (v); and
                    (D) by inserting after clause (iii) the following 
                new clause:
                    ``(iv) is a fashion model who is of distinguished 
                merit and ability and who is seeking to enter the 
                United States temporarily to perform fashion modeling 
                services that involve events or productions which have 
                a distinguished reputation or that are performed for an 
                organization or establishment that has a distinguished 
                reputation for, or a record of, utilizing prominent

        Section 214(a)(2)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 
        U.S.C. 1184(a)(2)(B)) is amended in the second sentence--
                    (A) by inserting ``or fashion models'' after 
                ``athletes''; and
                    (B) by inserting ``or fashion model'' after 
                ``athlete''.
    (b) Elimination of H-1B Classification for Fashion Models.--Section 
101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b) of such Act (8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b)) is 
amended--
            (1) by striking ``or as a fashion model''; and

        distinguished merit and ability''.
    (c) Effective Date and Implementation.--
            (1) In general.--The amendments made by this section shall 
        take effect on the date of the enactment of this Act.
            (2) Regulations, guidelines, and precedents.--The

        as added by this Act, except to the extent modified by the 
        Secretary of Homeland Security through final regulations (not 
        through interim regulations) promulgated in accordance with the 
        Administrative Procedures Act.
            (3) Construction.--Nothing in this section shall be 
        construed as preventing an alien who is a fashion model from 
        obtaining nonimmigrant status under section 101(a)(15)(O)(i) of 
        the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 
        1101(a)(15)(O)(i)) if such alien is otherwise qualified for 
        such status.
            (4) Treatment of pending petitions.--Petitions filed on 
        behalf of fashion models under section 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b) of 
        the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 
        1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b)) that are pending on the date of the 
        enactment of this Act shall be treated as if they had been 
        filed under section 101(a)(15)(P)(iv) of the Immigration and 
        Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(15)(P)(iv)), as added by this 
        Act.

        issued to beneficiaries of petitions filed under section 
        101(a)(15)(P)(iv) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 
        U.S.C. 1101(a)(15)(P)(iv)) shall be for the full period of 
        approval notwithstanding the reciprocity validity periods that 
        would otherwise be applicable.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
