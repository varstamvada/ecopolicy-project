SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Women in the United States and around the world are the 
        linchpin of families and communities and are often the first to 
        feel the immediate and adverse effects of social, 
        environmental, and economic stresses on their families and 
        communities.
            (2) The United Nations has recognized, as one of the 
        central organizing principles for its work, that ``no enduring 
        solution to society's most threatening social, economic and 
        political problems can be found without the full participation, 
        and the full empowerment, of the world's women''.
            (3) The United Nations Development Programme 2013 Human 
        Development Report has found that the number of people living 
        in extreme poverty could increase by up to 3,000,000,000 by 
        2050 unless environmental disasters are averted by coordinated 
        global action.
            (4) Climate change is already forcing the most vulnerable 
        communities and populations in developing countries to face 
        unprecedented climate stress, including water scarcity and 
        drought, as well as severe weather events and floods, which can 
        lead to reduced agricultural productivity, food insecurity, and 
        increased disease.
            (5) Climate change exacerbates issues of scarcity and lack 
        of accessibility to primary natural resources, forest 
        resources, and arable land for food production, thereby 
        contributing to increased conflict and instability, as well as 
        the workload and stresses on women farmers, who are estimated 
        to produce 60 to 80 percent of the food in most developing 
        countries.
            (6) Women will disproportionately face harmful impacts from 
        climate change, particularly in poor and developing nations 
        where women regularly assume increased responsibility for 
        growing the family's food and collecting water, fuel, and other 
        resources.
            (7) Epidemics, such as malaria and zika, are expected to 
        worsen and spread due to variations in climate, putting women 
        (especially pregnant mothers and women who hope to become 
        pregnant) and children without access to prevention and medical 
        services at risk.
            (8) The direct and indirect effects of climate change have 
        a disproportionate impact on marginalized women, such as 
        environmental refugees and displaced persons, migrants, 
        religious, racial, or ethnic minorities, adolescent girls, 
        lesbian and trans women, women living in poverty, and women and 
        girls with disabilities and those who are living with HIV.
            (9) Conflict has a disproportionate impact on the most 
        vulnerable communities and populations, including women, and is 
        fueled in the poorest regions of the world by harsher climates, 
        leading to migration, refugee crises, and conflicts over scarce 
        natural resources, including land and water.
            (10) Displaced, refugee, and stateless women and girls face 
        extreme violence and threats, including--
                    (A) being forced to exchange sex for food and 
                humanitarian supplies;
                    (B) being at increased risk of rape, sexual 
                exploitation, and abuse; and
                    (C) being at increased risk for HIV, sexually 
                transmitted infections (STIs), unplanned pregnancy, and 
                poor reproductive health.
            (11) It is predicted that climate change will lead to 
        increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather 
        conditions, precipitating the occurrence of natural disasters 
        around the globe.
            (12) The relocation and death of women, and especially 
        mothers, as a result of climate-related disasters often has 
        devastating impacts on social support networks, family ties, 
        and the coping capacity of families and communities.
            (13) The ability of women to adapt to climate change is 
        constrained by a lack of economic freedoms, property and 
        inheritance rights, and access to financial resources, 
        education, family planning and reproductive health, and new 
        tools, equipment, and technology.
            (14) Despite having a unique capacity and knowledge to 
        promote and provide for adaptation to climate change, women 
        often have insufficient resources to undertake such adaptation.
            (15) Women are shown to have a multiplier effect because 
        women use their income and resources, when given the necessary 
        tools, to increase the well-being of their children and 
        families, and thus play a critical role in reducing food 
        insecurity, poverty, and socioeconomic effects of climate 
        change.
            (16) Women are often underrepresented in the development 
        and formulation of policy regarding mitigation and adaptation 
        to climate change, even though women are often in the best 
        position to provide and consult on adaptive strategies.

congressional committees a United States National and International 
Strategy to prevent and respond to the effects of climate change on 
women.
    (b) Contents.--The strategy submitted under subsection (a) shall 
include--
            (1) recognizing the disparate impacts of climate change on 
        women and the efforts of women globally to address climate 
        change;
            (2) taking effective action--
                    (A) to prevent and respond to climate change and

            (9) developing policies to support women who are 
        particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change to 
        prepare for, build their resilience to, and adapt to such 
        impacts, including a commitment to increase education and 
        training opportunities for women to develop local resilience 
        plans to address the effects of climate change;
            (10) developing and investing in programs for the education 
        and empowerment of women and girls in the United States and 
        across the global community, including to gather information on 
        how climate change is affecting their lives and for guidance on

        climate change, in coordination with the diplomatic missions of 
        other countries;
            (11) consulting with representatives of civil society, 
        including nongovernmental organizations, community and faith-
