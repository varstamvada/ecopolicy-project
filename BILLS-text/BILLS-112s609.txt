                                from the cumulative compliance 
                                obligations of the Federal regulatory 
                                mandates.

                        on the economies of local communities that are

                        impacted units described in clause (i) and 
                        increased retail electricity, transportation 
                        fuels, heating oil, and petrochemical prices 
                        that are forecasted under clause (ii),

                        indirect adverse economic impacts identified 
                        under clause (v) can be mitigated through the 
                        creation of additional jobs and new economic 
                        growth as a result of renewable energy 
                        projects, energy efficiency measures, and other 
                        such energy construction projects that are

                        industries and businesses in the United States 
                        to compete with industries and businesses in 
                        other countries, with respect to 
                        competitiveness in both domestic and foreign

                                and indirect adverse impacts from the

                                increased retail electricity, 
                                transportation fuels, heating oil, and 
                                petrochemicals price, as identified

                                adverse impacts due to the creation of 
                                new jobs and economic growth that are 
                                expected to result directly and 
                                indirectly from the energy construction 
                                projects, as identified under clause 
                                (vi).

                        sector, including--
                                    (I) adverse impacts on electric 
                                reliability that are expected to result 
                                from the retirement of electric 
                                generating units identified under 
                                clause (i);
                                    (II) the geographical distribution 
                                of the projected adverse electric 
                                reliability impacts identified in 
                                subclause (I), according to the regions

                                can be optimized to mitigate those 
                                projected adverse reliability impacts.
                            (x) Federal, State, and local policies that 
                        have been or will be implemented to foster a 
                        transition in energy infrastructure in the
