                   IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES

                             July 23, 2019

 Mr. Graham (for himself, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. Lee, Mr. Cruz, 
 Mr. Sasse, Mr. Hawley, Mr. Tillis, Ms. Ernst, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Kennedy, 
   and Mrs. Blackburn) submitted the following resolution; which was 
referred to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs

                               RESOLUTION


 
   Commending the officers and personnel of U.S. Customs and Border 
  Protection for their work during the crisis at the Southern border.

Whereas U.S. Customs and Border Protection (referred to in this preamble as 
        ``CBP'') is charged with protecting the borders of the United States and 
        facilitating travel and trade;
Whereas the Southern border of the United States is experiencing unprecedented 
        numbers of vulnerable individuals attempting to enter the country;
Whereas, in June 2019, 104,344 individuals were apprehended at the Southern 
        border, which is an increase of more than 140 percent, as compared to 
        June 2018;
Whereas, as of June 2019, the number of individuals apprehended or determined to 
        be inadmissible by CBP at the Southern border in fiscal year 2019 is 
        780,638, already surpassing the fiscal year 2014 total of 569,287, which 
        was the highest such number in the preceding 5 years;
Whereas the Homeland Security Advisory Council expects Southwest border 
        migration numbers to approach or exceed 1,000,000 individuals in fiscal 
        year 2019 unless immediate action is taken;
Whereas, historically, the majority of individuals arriving at the Southern 
        border have been single adult males from Mexico, but by May 2019, 72 
        percent of all border enforcement actions were associated with 
        unaccompanied children and family units;
Whereas, due to the constant and increasing flow of migrants crossing the 
        Southern border between ports of entry, financial and human resources 
        are being diverted from the security and law enforcement duties of CBP, 
        resulting in--

    (1) fewer seizures of narcotics and illicit currency; and

    (2) increased wait times at ports of entry, leading to warnings of 
possible produce shortages and interruptions in supply chains;

Whereas more than 40 percent of CBP resources are currently being absorbed by 
        the humanitarian crisis at the Southern border;
Whereas the final emergency interim report published by the Homeland Security 
        Advisory Council on April 16, 2019, notes that a substantial number of 
        individuals who are apprehended by CBP require significant personal and 
        medical care that exceeds the ability and capacity of CBP, despite 
        creative and humane attempts by CBP to care for such individuals in CBP 
        custody;
Whereas CBP officers and personnel have raised concerns that overcrowding poses 
        immediate risks to--

    (1) the health and safety of the migrants; and

    (2) CBP officers;

Whereas CBP officers are experiencing both physical illness and severe mental 
        and emotional distress as a result of the crisis at the Southern border;
Whereas, in May 2019, the Commissioner of CBP requested an additional $2,100,000 
        for the Employee Assistance Program of CBP in order to offer additional 
        counseling services to CBP officers and personnel to respond to 
        ``unanticipated critical incidents and other emerging crises, such as 
        the unexpected response required for migrant caravans, employee 
        suicides, and the need for a financial wellness program''; and
Whereas, in the face of the most difficult circumstances, CBP officers and 
        personnel continue--

    (1) to work undaunted to protect the Southern border; and

    (2) to care for the migrants in CBP custody: Now, therefore, be it

    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) commends the men and women of U.S. Customs and Border 
        Protection, including Border Patrol personnel, Office of Field 
        Operations personnel, Air and Marine Operations personnel, 
        Office of Trade personnel, and all support personnel and their 
        allies for their continued honorable service during the 
        challenging humanitarian crisis at the Southern border; and
            (2) calls on Congress to pass legislation to support U.S. 
        Customs and Border Protection officers and to manage the 
        increasing flow of migrants attempting to enter the United 
        States.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
