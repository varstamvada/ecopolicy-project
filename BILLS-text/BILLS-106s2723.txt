 To amend the Clean Air Act to permit the Governor of a State to waive 
the oxygen content requirement for reformulated gasoline, to encourage 
 development of voluntary standards to prevent and control releases of

motor vehicle engine, nonroad engine, or nonroad vehicle, if in the 
judgment of the Administrator the oxygenated fuel additive causes or 
contributes to air pollution or water pollution that may reasonably be 
anticipated to endanger the public health or welfare.''.

        Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency a State 
        implementation plan revision that provides for the reduction or 
        elimination of the use of methyl tertiary butyl ether in 
        gasoline sold or introduced into commerce in the State if the 
        Governor of the State demonstrates that--
                    (A) the reduction or elimination would not cause 
                any significant disruption in the availability, supply, 
                or price of gasoline in the State;
                    (B) the reduction or elimination is necessary to 
                protect the public health or environment; and
                    (C) any alternative additive used will not present 
                an equivalent or greater problem than any problem posed 
                by the use of methyl tertiary butyl ether.
            (2) Special rule.--Paragraph (1)--
                    (A) does not apply to a State described in section 
                211(c)(4)(B) of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 
                7545(c)(4)(B)); and

                under section 211(c)(4)(B) of that Act to at any time 
                prescribe and enforce a control or prohibition 
                respecting methyl tertiary butyl ether or any other 
                fuel additive.
    (c) Permit Application Assistance.--In the case of any State in 
which are located 1 or more facilities that produce methyl tertiary 
butyl ether and that, as a result of any provision of or amendment made 
by this Act, apply for a new permit or permit modification under the 
Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.), the Administrator of the 
Environmental Protection Agency shall provide to the State technical 
assistance and personnel to assist in the application for or 
modification of such permits.

SEC. 5. ASSURANCE OF ADEQUATE FUEL SUPPLY.

    (a) In General.--In order to ensure an adequate fuel supply for all 
States, any regulation or modification of fuel properties promulgated 
or approved by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency 
under this Act or an amendment made by this Act shall take into 
consideration the need for reasonable schedules for carrying out 
necessary refinery investment projects and making appropriate 
modifications to fuel distribution systems.
    (b) Fuel Industry Flexibility.--In implementing and enforcing 
regulations and modifications described in subsection (a), the 
Administrator shall provide the fuel industry with the flexibility 
inherent in fuel regulations in effect on the day before the date of 
enactment of this Act.
