    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

    This Act may be cited as the ``Prohibiting Taxpayer Funded 
Settlements for Illegal Immigrants Act''.

memorandum of the Attorney General regarding ``Zero-Tolerance for 
Offenses Under 8 U.S.C. Sec.  1325(a)'', issued on April 6, 2018, were

intended to compensate such individuals for being separated from family 
members during such detention.
