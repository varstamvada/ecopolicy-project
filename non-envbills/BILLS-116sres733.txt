_______________________________________________________________________

                               RESOLUTION


 
   Recognizing 2020 as the centennial of the Preservation Society of 
                              Charleston.

Whereas the Preservation Society of Charleston, founded in 1920, is the oldest 
        citizen-based preservation organization in the United States;
Whereas the Preservation Society of Charleston played a critical role in 
        positioning the historic and beautiful city of Charleston, South 
        Carolina, as a leader in the protection of architectural resources and 
        vibrant communities by spearheading the effort to pass the first 
        historic district zoning ordinance in the United States in 1931, which 
        is now known worldwide as the ``Charleston Ordinance'';
Whereas the Preservation Society of Charleston has a lengthy record of successes 
        in saving iconic buildings and neighborhoods throughout the city of 
        Charleston, including--

    (1) the Dock Street Theater;

    (2) the Lining House;

    (3) the Old Exchange Building;

    (4) Rainbow Row; and

    (5) countless other historic buildings on the peninsula of Charleston;

Whereas the Preservation Society of Charleston was founded by a woman, Susan 
        Pringle Frost, whose vision, determination, and energy set the 
        preservation movement on a new path in the early 20th century;
Whereas, for 100 years, the Preservation Society of Charleston has provided 
        countless avenues for women's leadership, boasting exemplary leaders 
        such as--

    (1) Elizabeth O'Neill Verner;

    (2) Dorothy Legge;

    (3) Elizabeth Jenkins Young; and

    (4) Jane Thornhill;

Whereas, in the words of an award citation from the American Institute of 
        Architects, the Preservation Society of Charleston is ``as much a part 
        of Charleston history as a protector of it'' and has ``wrought a 
        standard of commitment to community befitting the beauty and rich legacy 
        of the city it has served'';
Whereas, through innovative programs such as the Charleston Justice Journey and 
        the Thomas Mayhem Pinckney Alliance, the Preservation Society of 
        Charleston recognizes the contributions of African Americans to the 
        built environment and history of Charleston; and
Whereas the Preservation Society of Charleston has established itself as the 
        leading voice in advocating for a livable and human city, showing itself 
        consistently and repeatedly to be small but mighty, thoughtful but 
        nimble, and principled, professional, and unafraid: Now, therefore, be 
        it
    Resolved, That the Senate recognizes 2020 as the centennial of the 
Preservation Society of Charleston.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
