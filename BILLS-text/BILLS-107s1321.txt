                                 A BILL


 
To authorize the construction of a Native American Cultural Center and 
                   Museum in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. OKLAHOMA NATIVE AMERICAN CULTURAL CENTER AND MUSEUM.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) In order to promote better understanding between Indian 
        and non-Indian citizens of the United States, and in light of 
        the Federal Government's continuing trust responsibilities to 
        Indian tribes, it is appropriate, desirable, and a proper 
        function of the Federal Government to provide grants for the 
        development of a museum designated to display the heritage and 
        culture of Indian tribes.
            (2) In recognition of the unique status and history of 
        Indian tribes in the State of Oklahoma and the role of the 
        Federal Government in such history, it is appropriate and 
        proper for the museum referred to in paragraph (1) to be 
        located in the State of Oklahoma.
    (b) Grant.--
            (1) In general.--The Secretary shall offer to award 
        financial assistance equaling not more than $33,000,000 and 
        technical assistance to the Authority to be used for the 
        development and construction of a Native American Cultural 
        Center and Museum in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.
            (2) Agreement.--To be eligible to receive a grant under 
        paragraph (1), the appropriate official of the Authority 
        shall--
                    (A) enter into a grant agreement with the Secretary 
                which shall specify the duties of the Authority under 
                this section, including provisions for continual 
                maintenance of the Center by the Authority without the 
                use of Federal funds; and
                    (B) demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the 
                Secretary, that the Authority has raised, or has 
                commitments from private persons or State or local 
                government agencies for, an amount that is equal to not 
                less than 66 percent of the cost to the Authority of 
                the activities to be carried out under the grant.
            (3) Limitation.--The amount of any grant awarded under 
        paragraph (1) shall not exceed 33 percent of the cost of the 
        activities to be funded under the grant.
            (4) In-kind contribution.--When calculating the cost share 
        of the Authority under this Act, the Secretary shall reduce 
        such cost share obligation by the fair market value of the 
        approximately 300 acres of land donated by Oklahoma City for 
        the Center, if such land is used for the Center.
    (c) Definitions.--For the purposes of this Act:
            (1) Authority.--The term ``Authority'' means the Native 
        American Cultural and Educational Authority of Oklahoma, and 
        agency of the State of Oklahoma.
