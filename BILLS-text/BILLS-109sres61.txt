Whereas the National Ready Mixed Concrete Association has been a pioneer in the 
        field of concrete technology through groundbreaking research and

Whereas the National Ready Mixed Concrete Association has gained national 
        distinction by developing innovative breakthroughs in engineering,

Whereas the National Ready Mixed Concrete Association will continue to look
