        importance to the health, safety, and well-being of the people of the 
        United States;
Whereas those facilities and services could not be provided without the 
        dedicated efforts of public works professionals, engineers, and 
        administrators who represent State and local governments throughout the 
        United States;
Whereas those individuals design, build, operate, and maintain the 
        transportation systems, water supply infrastructure, sewage and refuse 
        disposal systems, public buildings, and other structures and facilities 
        that are vital to the citizens and communities of the United States; and
Whereas it is in the interest of the public for citizens and civic leaders to 
        understand the role that public infrastructure plays in--

    (1) protecting the environment;

    (2) improving public health and safety;

    (3) contributing to economic vitality; and

    (4) enhancing the quality of life of every community of the United 
States: Now, therefore, be it

    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) proclaims the week of May 21 through May 27, 2006, as 
        ``National Public Works Week'';
            (2) recognizes and celebrates the important contributions 
        that public works professionals make every day to improve--
                    (A) the public infrastructure of the United States; 
                and
                    (B) the communities that those professionals serve; 
                and
            (3) urges citizens and communities throughout the United 
        States to join with representatives of the Federal Government 
        and the American Public Works Association in activities and 
        ceremonies that are designed--
                    (A) to pay tribute to the public works 
                professionals of the Nation; and
                    (B) to recognize the substantial contributions that 
                public works professionals make to the Nation.
