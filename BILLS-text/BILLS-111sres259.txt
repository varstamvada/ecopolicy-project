                   IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES

                           September 10, 2009

   Mr. Inhofe (for himself and Mr. Nelson of Nebraska) submitted the 
        following resolution; which was considered and agreed to

_______________________________________________________________________

                               RESOLUTION


 
Designating September 13, 2009, as ``National Celiac Disease Awareness 
                                 Day''.

Whereas celiac disease affects approximately 1 in every 130 people in the United 
        States, for a total of 3,000,000 people;
Whereas the majority of people with celiac disease have yet to be diagnosed;
Whereas celiac disease is a chronic inflammatory disorder that is classified as 
        both an autoimmune condition and a genetic condition;
Whereas celiac disease causes damage to the lining of the small intestine, which 
        results in overall malnutrition;
Whereas when a person with celiac disease consumes foods that contain certain 
        protein fractions, that person suffers a cell-mediated immune response 
        that damages the villi of the small intestine, interfering with the 
        absorption of nutrients in food and the effectiveness of medications;
Whereas such problematic protein fractions are found in wheat, barley, rye, and 
        oats, which are used to produce many foods, medications, and vitamins;
Whereas because celiac disease is a genetic disease, there is an increased 
        incidence of celiac disease in families with a known history of celiac 
        disease;
Whereas celiac disease is underdiagnosed because the symptoms can be attributed 
        to other conditions and are easily overlooked by doctors and patients;
Whereas as recently as 2000, the average person with celiac disease waited 11 
        years for a correct diagnosis;
Whereas \1/2\ of all people with celiac disease do not show symptoms of the 
        disease;
Whereas celiac disease is diagnosed by tests that measure the blood for 
        abnormally high levels of the antibodies of immunoglobulin A, anti-
        tissue transglutaminase, and IgA anti-endomysium antibodies;
Whereas celiac disease can be treated only by implementing a diet free of wheat, 
        barley, rye, and oats, often called a ``gluten-free diet'';
Whereas a delay in the diagnosis of celiac disease can result in damage to the 
        small intestine, which leads to an increased risk for malnutrition, 
        anemia, lymphoma, adenocarcinoma, osteoporosis, miscarriage, congenital 
        malformation, short stature, and disorders of skin and other organs;
Whereas celiac disease is linked to many autoimmune disorders, including thyroid 
        disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, type 1 diabetes, liver disease, 
        collagen vascular disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and Sjogren's syndrome;
Whereas the connection between celiac disease and diet was first established by 
        Dr. Samuel Gee, who wrote, ``if the patient can be cured at all, it must 
        be by means of diet'';
Whereas Dr. Samuel Gee was born on September 13, 1839; and
Whereas the Senate is an institution that can raise awareness in the general 
        public and the medical community of celiac disease: Now, therefore, be 
        it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates September 13, 2009, as ``National Celiac 
        Disease Awareness Day'';
            (2) recognizes that all people of the United States should 
        become more informed and aware of celiac disease;
            (3) calls upon the people of the United States to observe 
        National Celiac Disease Awareness Day with appropriate 
        ceremonies and activities; and
            (4) respectfully requests the Secretary of the Senate to 
        transmit a copy of this resolution to the Celiac Sprue 
        Association, the American Celiac Society, and the Celiac 
        Disease Foundation.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
