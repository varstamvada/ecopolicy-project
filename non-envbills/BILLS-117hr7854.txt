                    (A) In general.--An alien present in the United 
                States who has been subject to an order of exclusion, 
                deportation, removal, or voluntary departure under any 
                provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 
                U.S.C. 1101 et seq.) may, notwithstanding such order, 
                submit an application for adjustment of status under 
                this subsection if the alien is otherwise eligible for 
                adjustment of status under paragraph (1).
                    (B) Separate motion not required.--An alien 
                described in subparagraph (A) shall not be required, as 
                a condition of submitting or granting an application 
                under this subsection, to file a separate motion to 
                reopen, reconsider, or vacate an order described in 
                subparagraph (A).
                    (C) Effect of decision by secretary.--
                            (i) Grant.--If the Secretary adjusts the 
                        status of an alien pursuant to an application 
                        under this subsection, the Secretary shall 
                        cancel any order described in subparagraph (A) 
                        to which the alien has been subject.
                            (ii) Denial.--If the Secretary makes a 
                        final decision to deny such application, any 
                        such order shall be effective and enforceable 
                        to the same extent that such order would be 
                        effective and enforceable if the application 
                        had not been made.

        physical presence based on one or more absences from the United

                Secretary may not order an alien to be removed from the 
                United States if the alien--

                status under subsection (b) of the alien.
            (3) Work authorization.--

                        engage in employment in the United States 
                        during the period in which a determination on 
                        such application is pending; and
                            (ii) provide such alien with an 
                        ``employment authorized'' endorsement or other 
                        appropriate document signifying authorization 
                        of employment.
                    (B) Pending applications.--If an application for 
                adjustment of status under subsection (b) is pending 
                for a period exceeding 180 days and has not been

                the applicable alien.

residence for the alien as of the date of the arrival of the alien in 
the United States.
    (f) Availability of Administrative Review.--The Secretary shall 
provide applicants for adjustment of status under subsection (b) with

provided to--

        of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1255); and
            (2) aliens subject to removal proceedings under section 240 
        of such Act (8 U.S.C. 1229a).
    (g) Limitation on Judicial Review.--
            (1) In general.--A determination by the Secretary with 
        respect to the adjustment of status of any alien under this 
        section is final and shall not be subject to review by any 
        court.
            (2) Rule of construction.--Nothing in paragraph (1) shall 
        be construed to preclude the review of a constitutional claim

        States Code, with respect to a denial of adjustment of status 
        under this section.

        construed to repeal, amend, alter, modify, effect, or restrict

        the administration and enforcement of the Immigration and 
        Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq.) or any other law 
        relating to immigration, nationality, or naturalization.
            (2) Effect of eligibility for adjustment of status.--The 
        eligibility of an alien to be lawfully admitted for permanent 
        residence under this section shall not preclude the alien from 
        seeking any status under any other provision of law for which 
        the alien may otherwise be eligible.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
