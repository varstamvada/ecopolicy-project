    Expressing support for the recognition of July 2022 as ``Muslim-
 American Heritage Month'' and celebrating the heritage and culture of 
                 Muslim Americans in the United States.

Whereas the Senate is proud to recognize and commemorate ``Muslim-American 
        Heritage Month'', an observance that celebrates the contributions of 
        Muslim Americans;
Whereas, in keeping with its time-honored traditions, the Senate recognizes and 
        pays tribute to those who foster cultural pride and enhance the profile 
        of diverse communities across the United States;

        with the arrival of indentured workers;

        slaves of Muslim heritage were brought to the United States;
Whereas, in the 19th, 20th, and 21st centuries, successive waves of immigration 
        brought additional Muslims to the United States, who sought to pursue 
        economic and social opportunity, as well as freedom of religion, and 
        enriched the fabric of the society of the United States as business 
        owners, entrepreneurs, health care professionals, humanitarians, 
        scientists, and students;
Whereas Muslim Americans contribute greatly to charitable organizations that 
        help people from all faiths in the United States and around the world by 
        feeding the hungry, providing recuperation efforts following natural 
        disasters, and providing medical assistance, family services, scholastic 
        supplies, and before and after school programs;
Whereas Muslim Americans have contributed to every part of the society of the 
        United States to make advancements in architecture, arts, business, 
        culture, diplomacy, government, law, medicine, the military, national 
        security, religion, and sports;
Whereas Bangladeshi-American Fazlur Rahman Khan left his mark on cityscapes in 
        the United States by pioneering a new structural system of frame tubes

        York City, the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome in Minneapolis, and the 
        Willis ``Sears'' Tower in Chicago;
Whereas many Muslim Americans pursue the American dream and contribute to the 
        economy of the United States as business owners and entrepreneurs,

        parts company Flex-N-Gate and the National Football League team 
        Jacksonville Jaguars;

        practical confection with a near ubiquitous presence in the lives of the 
        people of the United States;

        States to 57 Muslim-majority nations;

        for his supporting role in ``Moonlight'' in 2017;

        Religious Freedom;
Whereas Pakistani-American neurosurgeon Ayub Ommaya's invention of the 
        intraventricular catheter system provides chemotherapy to treat brain 
        tumors;
Whereas Muslim Americans have fought in support of the United States in every 
        major war, from Bampett Muhamed and Yusuf Ben Ali under the command of 
        General George Washington in the American Revolutionary War to Captain 
        Humayun Khan, who made the ultimate sacrifice in Iraq in 2004;
Whereas Imam Warith Deen Mohammed, the first Muslim American to deliver an

        activist and reformer also known as Malcolm X, were prominent religious 
        leaders and scholars;
Whereas Muslim American professional athletes like National Basketball 
        Association Hall of Fame members Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Hakeem Olajuwon,

        Shariff Rahman, thrilled sports fans around the world during their 
        respective careers;
Whereas Muslim American Olympians, such as boxer Muhammad Ali, track and field 
        athlete Dalilah Muhammad, and fencer Ibtihaj Muhammad, won medals in 
        international competitions;
Whereas, with roots in at least 77 different countries, and identifying racially 
        as White, Black, Arab, and Asian, Muslim Americans are an extremely 
        diverse population;
Whereas the current population of Muslims living in the United States is 
        estimated at more than 3,450,000;
Whereas more than 7,400 Muslims serve on active duty and more than 4,000 Muslims 
        serve as selected reserve personnel in the Armed Forces of the United 
        States;
Whereas the Muslim population has been growing in the United States, and the 
        Muslim-American population is a tapestry of ethnic, racial, linguistic, 
        social, and economic groups;
Whereas nearly 50 percent of Muslim Americans have reported experiencing 
        religious discrimination, with that number rising to 64 percent for 
        Muslim Americans whose appearance identifies them as Muslim, such as 
        women who wear a hijab, or headscarf; and
Whereas the incredible contributions and heritage of Muslim Americans have 
        helped to build a better United States: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates the month of July 2022 as ``Muslim-American 
        Heritage Month'';
            (2) honors the contributions and integral role of Muslim 
        Americans to the economy, culture, and identity of the United 
        States;
            (3) recognizes the need for public education, awareness, 
        and policies that are culturally competent when describing, 
        discussing, or addressing the impacts of being Muslim American 
        in all aspects of the society of the United States, including 
        in discourse and policy; and
            (4) urges the people of the United States to observe 
        ``Muslim-American Heritage Month'' with appropriate ceremonies, 
        programs, and activities that celebrate the contributions of 
        Muslim Americans to the United States.
