SECTION 1. PLANS TO IMPROVE MEDICAL FACILITIES OF THE DEPARTMENT OF 
              VETERANS AFFAIRS.

    (a) Plans Required.--
            (1) Plans of directors of medical facilities.--The 
        Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall require each director of a 
        medical facility of the Department of Veterans Affairs to 
        submit to the director of the facility's Veterans Integrated 
        Service Network, not later than 90 days after the date of the 
        enactment of this Act, a plan to improve such facility in such 
        a fashion as would result in the facility obtaining a 
        Department five-star rating.
            (2) Plans of directors of veterans integrated service 
        networks.--The Secretary shall require each director of a 
        Veterans Integrated Service Network to submit to the Secretary, 
        not later than 60 days after receiving all of the plans under 
        paragraph (1), a plan, based on the plans received under 
        paragraph (1), to improve the facilities within the Veterans 
        Integrated Service Network in such a fashion that would improve 
        the rating of all facilities within the network.
            (3) Contents.--The Secretary shall ensure that each plan 
        submitted under this subsection includes sufficient detail 
        regarding resources, personnel changes, hiring authorities, 
        additional staffing, and changes to information systems as is 
        necessary to obtain the rating described in paragraphs (1) and 
        (2).
    (b) Annual Reports.--The Secretary shall ensure that, in the first 
fiscal year beginning after the date that is 90 days after the date of 
the enactment of this Act and not less frequently than once each fiscal 
year thereafter, each director of a Veterans Integrated Service Network 
in which a medical facility of the Department has a one-, two-, or 
three-star rating submits to the Secretary a report on the actions 
taken by the director to carry out the plan submitted by the director 
under subsection (a)(2) and to obtain for the facility the rating 
described in such subsection.
    (c) Sense of Congress on Use of Authorities To Investigate Medical 
Centers of the Department of Veterans Affairs.--It is the sense of 
Congress that the Secretary of Veterans Affairs should make full use of 
the authorities provided by section 2 of the Enhancing Veteran Care Act 
(Public Law 115-95).
