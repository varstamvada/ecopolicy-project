   enforcement agencies to obtain behavioral health crisis response 
                 training for law enforcement officers.

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Law Enforcement Training for Mental 
Health Crisis Response Act of 2019''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) Law enforcement officers routinely respond to 
        emergencies involving individuals suffering from a mental 
        health crisis.
            (2) Recent statistics have shown that as many as--
                    (A) 1 in every 10 calls for police response involve 
                a person suffering from a mental illness;
                    (B) 1 in every 4 people killed by police suffer 
                from a mental health problem; and
                    (C) 1 in 3 people transported to a hospital 
                emergency room for psychiatric reasons are taken by the 
                police.
            (3) Law enforcement response calls to individuals suffering 
        from substance use disorder have increased during the current 
        opioid epidemic.
            (4) There is a need to ensure that law enforcement officers 
        have access to proper evidence-based training in responding to 
        mental health crises.
            (5) Proper training for response to individuals suffering 
        from a mental health crisis can better protect the safety of 
        the general public and law enforcement officers.
            (6) Law enforcement officers in the United States can 
        better serve their communities if the law enforcement officers 
        receive training to effectively and safely resolve the mental 
        health crises.
    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to provide grants to 
State, local, and Tribal law enforcement agencies to obtain behavioral 
health crisis response training for law enforcement officers to--
            (1) better train law enforcement officers to resolve 
        behavioral health crisis situations;
            (2) reduce the number of law enforcement officers killed or 
        injured while responding to a behavioral health crisis; and
            (3) reduce the number of individuals killed or injured 
        during a behavioral health crisis in which a law enforcement 
        officer responds.
