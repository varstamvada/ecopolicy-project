                               RESOLUTION


 
   Commemorating the life and legacy of Jean-Louis de Kerouac on the 
               centennial of his birth on March 12, 2022.

Whereas Jean-Louis de Kerouac, better known as ``Jack'', was a giant of American 
        literature and favorite son of Lowell, Massachusetts;
Whereas, alongside Allen Ginsberg and William Burroughs, Jack Kerouac ignited 
        the literary movement in the 1950s known as the ``Beat Generation'';
Whereas the Beat Generation's rebuke against traditional values and materialism 
        created the foundation for subsequent counterculture movements in 
        America and beyond;
Whereas the beatnik stereotype dominated popular media and culture in the 1950s 
        and 1960s, an amalgamation of Kerouac's self-expressive, unconventional 
        characters;
Whereas the ``Beatles'' took their name after the movement, while artists such 
        as Bob Dylan and Jim Morrison cite Kerouac's work as major influences; 
        and
Whereas, more than half a century since his death, Kerouac's novels still fire 
        the imagination, particularly of young people, and serve as a tribute to 
        their culture-changing origins: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives recognizes and 
commemorates the enduring contribution of Jack Kerouac's work to 
American literary culture and beyond on the centennial of his birth.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
