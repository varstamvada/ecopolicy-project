    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. FINDINGS.

    The Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Since before the fall of the Soviet Union, the nations 
        of Eastern Europe have proven their steadfast dedication to the 
        causes of freedom and friendship with the United States, 
        exemplified by the brave actions of Polish patriots during the 
        American Revolution, Czech resistance to Nazi occupation and 
        Hungarian revolutions against the Soviet Union despite 
        overwhelming opposition.
            (2) Eastern European history provides pioneering examples 
        of constitutional democracy and religious tolerance.
            (3) The United States is home to over 15,000,000 people of 
        Eastern European ancestry.
            (4) Eastern European immigrants have contributed greatly to 
        the success of industry and agriculture in the United States.
            (5) Since the demise of communism, Poland, Hungary and the 
        Czech Republic have become stable, democratic nations.
            (6) All of these countries have adopted economic policies 
        that promote free markets and rapid economic growth.
            (7) On April 15, 1991, Poland unilaterally repealed the 
        visa requirement for United States citizens traveling to Poland 
        for 90 days or less.
            (8) On April 30, 2004, the Czech Republic unilaterally 
        repealed the visa requirement for United States citizens 
        traveling to the Czech Republic for 90 days or less.
            (9) On November 1, 1990, Hungary unilaterally repealed the 
        visa requirement for United States citizens traveling to 
        Hungary for 90 days or less.
            (10) The Secretary of Homeland Security and Secretary of 
        State administer the visa waiver program, which allows citizens 
        from 27 countries, including France and Germany, to visit the 
        United States as tourists without visas.

SEC. 2. RENDERING CERTAIN EASTERN EUROPEAN COUTRIES VISA WAIVER PROGRAM 
              COUNTRIES.

    Effective on the date of the enactment of this Act, and 
notwithstanding section 217(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act 
(8 U.S.C. 1187(c)), Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Estonia, 
Latvia, and Lithuania shall be deemed designated program countries for 
purposes of the visa waiver program established under section 217 of 
such Act.
