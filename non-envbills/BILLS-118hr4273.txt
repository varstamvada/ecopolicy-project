                                 A BILL


 
To authorize the Director of the National Museum of American History of 
  the Smithsonian Institution to support LGBTQI+ history and women's 
          history education programs, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``LGBTQI+ and Women's History 
Education Act of 2023''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) According to the New-York Historical Society Museum & 
        Library, only 13 percent of named historical figures in 
        textbooks across the United States are women.
            (2) In 2017, the National Women's History Museum analyzed 
        elementary and secondary education standards in social studies 
        for all 50 States and the District of Columbia and found that:
                    (A) 53 percent of the mentions of women's history 
                were included within the context of domestic roles, 
                compared to 20 percent that were included within the 
                context of voting rights and suffrage, 9 percent in 
                women's rights movement of the 19th and mid-20th 
                centuries, 8 percent that were included within the 
                context of the civil rights movement, and 2 percent 
                that were included within the context of being in the 
                workforce.
                    (B) Named women do not reflect the diversity of 
                women and their contributions--only 8 percent of named 
                women are Hispanic and no named women are Asian 
                American.
                    (C) Disability rights, Native American rights, 
                LGBTQI+, and migrant labor movements are less 
                frequently included in standards and, when included, 
                are covered in less detail, providing fewer 
                opportunities to address women's contributions to these 
                movements.
            (3) According to a Smithsonian analysis of the 2017 
        National Women's History Museum study, approximately 1 woman 
        was mentioned for every 3 men in elementary and secondary 
        education standards in social studies.
            (4) According to the National Women's History Alliance, 
        only 3 States (Illinois, Florida, and Louisiana) have 
        legislated standards for inclusion of women's history in 
        elementary, middle, and high schools instruction.
            (5) According to GLSEN, only 7 States (California, 
        Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois, Nevada, New Jersey, and 
        Oregon) have passed legislation in support of an LGBTQI+ 
        inclusive curriculum.
            (6) In March 2022, Governor Ron DeSantis of Florida signed 
        HB 1557 into law. Commonly known as the ``Don't Say Gay or 
        Trans'' legislation, this law prevents teachers from 
        administering instruction on sexual orientation and gender 
        identity in kindergarten through third grade and, in 2023 the 
        Florida legislature expanded this prohibition on instruction to 
        8th grade (HB 1069), and the State Board of Education further 
        expanded this prohibition through 12th grade, with the 
        exception of health education.
            (7) According to the Movement Advancement Project, between 
        2021 and May 2023, 9 States passed curriculum censorship laws 
        that restrict instruction on LGBTQI+ people and issues 
        (Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, 
        Montana, and Tennessee).
            (8) According to the African American Policy Forum, at 
        least 16 States have passed racial and gender equity curriculum 
        prohibitions.
            (9) According to the ACLU, there have been over 200 anti-
        LGBTQI+ school and education bills introduced in 2023 in State 
        legislatures around the country, as of May 2023.
            (10) According to GLSEN, 4 States (Louisiana, Mississippi, 
        Oklahoma, and Texas) still have ``no promo homo'' laws in place 
        that prohibit positive and affirming representations of LGBTQI+ 
        identities in schools.
            (11) According to the CDC's 2021 Youth Risk Behavior Survey 
        of high school students, girls are more likely to be bullied at 
        school and electronically than boys.
            (12) LGBTQI+ youth experience high rates of mistreatment in 
        schools:
                    (A) According to the CDC's 2021 Youth Risk Behavior 
                Survey of high school students, lesbian, gay and 
                bisexual students are nearly twice as likely to be 
                bullied at school and are more than twice as likely to 
                be bullied electronically than their non-LGB peers.
                    (B) According to CDC's 2017 Youth Risk Behavior 
                Survey, high school students who identify as 
                transgender are more likely to be bullied at school and 
                electronically than cisgender girls and more than twice 
                as likely to be bullied at school and electronically 
                than cisgender boys.
                    (C) According to GLSEN's 2021 National School 
                Climate Survey, among LGBTQI+ secondary students who 
                attended school in-person during the 2020-2021 school 
                year, over 76 percent reported being verbally harassed, 
                over 31 percent reported being physically harassed, and 
                over 12 percent reported being physically assaulted 
                because of their sexual orientation, gender identity, 
                or gender expression with transgender students 
                reporting the highest rates of in-person victimization.
                    (D) According to a 2021 Trevor Project report, 45 
                percent of intersex students reported experiencing 
                gender-based harassment or discrimination from teachers 
                or faculty.
            (13) Nationally, only 16.3 percent of respondents to 
        GLSEN's 2021 National School Climate Survey said they had been 
        taught any positive representations of LGBTQI+ people, history, 
        or events in their classes, which represents a 3-point decline 
        from the 2019 survey.
            (14) According to the CDC's 2021 Youth Risk Behavior Survey 
        of high school students, women and girls, LGBQ+ students, and 
        students of color were least likely to feel connected at 
        school.
            (15) Countless studies show that when youth feel seen and 
        affirmed in their curricula, they experience improved academic 
        engagement and achievement.
                    (A) In participatory research the National Women's 
                Law Center conducted in partnership with Latina girls 
                in 2019, the girls reported that when they feel 
                represented in their curricula, they feel a powerful 
                sense of belonging and an emphasized identity of 
                resilience.
                    (B) GLSEN's 2021 National School Climate Survey 
                indicates that, compared to students in schools without 
                an LGBTQI+-inclusive curriculum, LGBTQI+ students in 
                schools with an LGBTQI+-inclusive curriculum were less 
                likely to hear homophobic slurs or negative remarks 
                about transgender people often or frequently; feel 
                unsafe because of their sexuality or gender identity; 
                or miss school because they felt unsafe or 
                uncomfortable.
            (16) Women and LGBTQI+ people--including those of color and 
        those with disabilities--have been and continue to be powerful 
        agents of change in United States history. For example:
                    (A) Black and Brown transgender women, including 
                Marsha P. Johnson, Miss Major Griffin-Gracy, Sylvia 
                Rivera, and Storme DeLarverie were prominent leaders 
                and participants of the 1969 protests against unjust 
                police raids of the New York City gay bar, the 
                Stonewall Inn, that ignited the national movement for 
                LGBTQI+ justice.
                    (B) Dr. Margaret Chung, a queer Chinese American 
                woman, advocated for Chinese Americans' and women's 
                right to vote at a time when women, particularly women 
                of color, were denied that right.
                    (C) Judith Ellen ``Judy'' Heumann is an 
                internationally recognized disability rights advocate 
                who played a leading role in the development and 
                implementation of major legislation, including the 
                Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, Section 
                504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the Americans 
                with Disabilities Act, and the Convention on the Rights 
                of Persons with Disabilities.
                    (D) Alice Wong is a queer disabled activist and the 
                founder and director of the Disability Visibility 
                Project who served on the National Council on 
                Disability.
                    (E) Ruby Bridges, a Black civil rights activist, 
                pioneered the school desegregation movement and was 
                among the first Black students to integrate schools in 
                the South at the age of six. Ruby's story, particularly 
                as it was memorialized in her children's book, Ruby 
                Bridges Goes to School: My True Story, continues to 
                inspire girls across the country but was also one of 
                the histories specifically targeted for censorship in 
                States prohibiting honest teachings about race.
            (17) Discrimination on the basis of sex (including sexual 
        orientation and gender identity) compounds with discrimination 
        on the basis of other identities, such as race, national 
        identity, religious background, or disability. Within 
        marginalized groups, compounding layers of discrimination 
        across intersectional identities often results in the most 
        marginalized members of a group being silenced or left out of 
        historical narratives.
            (18) All women, LGBTQI+ people, and those living at the 
        intersection of those identities, deserve to be represented in 
        classrooms across the country in an accurate, unbiased, 
        intersectional, and inclusive manner.
