                               RESOLUTION


 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that the Secretary 
  of Homeland Security should designate Haiti, Grenada, Jamaica, the 
     Dominican Republic, and the Bahamas under section 244 of the 
 Immigration and Nationality Act to make nationals of those countries 
      eligible for temporary protected status under that section.

Whereas in the midst of the devastating hurricane season of 2004, the United 
        States is sending individuals seeking asylum back to countries afflicted 
        with deadly violence and environmental disaster caused by hurricanes; 
        and
Whereas designating Haiti, Grenada, Jamaica, the Dominican Republic, and the 
        Bahamas under section 244 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 
        U.S.C. 1254a) will make nationals of those countries eligible to apply 
        for temporary protected status and temporarily remain in the United 
        States to work and reside: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Representatives that 
the Secretary of Homeland Security should designate Haiti, Grenada, 
Jamaica, the Dominican Republic, and the Bahamas under section 244 of 
the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1254a) to make nationals 
of those countries eligible for temporary protected status under that 
section.
