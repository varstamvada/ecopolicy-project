 including violence associated with drug trafficking, arms smuggling,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Border Enforcement Security Task 
Force Act of 2011''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND DECLARATION OF PURPOSES.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) overriding 
        mission is to lead a unified national effort to protect the 
        United States. United States Immigration and Customs 
        Enforcement (ICE) is the largest investigative agency within 
        DHS and is charged with enforcing a wide array of laws, 
        including laws related to securing the border and combating 
        criminal smuggling.
            (2) Mexico's northern border with the United States has 
        experienced a dramatic surge in border crime and violence in 
        recent years due to intense competition between Mexican drug 
        cartels and criminal smuggling organizations that employ 
        predatory tactics to realize their profits.
            (3) Law enforcement agencies at the United States northern 
        border face similar challenges from transnational smuggling 
        organizations.
            (4) In response, DHS has partnered with Federal, State, 
        local, tribal, and foreign law enforcement counterparts to 
        create the Border Enforcement Security Task Force (BEST) 
        initiative as a comprehensive approach to addressing border 
        security threats. These multi-agency teams are designed to 
        increase information-sharing and collaboration among the 
        participating law enforcement agencies.
            (5) BEST teams incorporate personnel from ICE, United 
        States Customs and Border Protection (CBP), the Drug 
        Enforcement Administration (DEA), the Bureau of Alcohol, 
        Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATFE), the Federal Bureau of 
        Investigation (FBI), the United States Coast Guard (USCG), and 
        the U.S. Attorney's Office (USAO), along with other key 
        Federal, State and local law enforcement agencies.
            (6) Foreign law enforcement agencies include Mexico's 
        Secretaria de Seguridad Publica (SSP), the Canada Border 
        Services Agency (CBSA), the Ontario Provincial Police (OPP), 
        and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP).

        Prior to establishing a BEST unit, the Assistant Secretary

                tribal, and foreign law enforcement resources to 
                participate in the BEST unit.
                    (C) The extent to which border security threats are 
                having a significant harmful impact in the jurisdiction 
                in which the BEST unit is to be established, and other 
                jurisdictions of the country.
    (d) Operation.--After making a designation under subsection (c)(2), 
and in order to provide Federal assistance to the area so designated, 
the Secretary of Homeland Security may--
            (1) obligate such sums as are appropriated for the BEST 
        program;
            (2) direct the assignment of Federal personnel to the BEST 
        program, subject to the approval of the head of the department 
        or agency that employs such personnel; and
            (3) take other actions to assist State, local, tribal, and 
        foreign jurisdictions to participate in the BEST program.
    (e) Report.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the 
establishment of the BEST program under subsection (a) and annually 
thereafter, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall submit to Congress 
a report on the effectiveness of the BEST program in enhancing border 
security and reducing the drug trafficking, arms smuggling, illegal 
alien trafficking and smuggling, violence, and kidnapping along and 
across the international borders of the United States as measured by 
crime statistics, including violent deaths, incidents of violence, and 
drug related arrests.
    (f) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized to be 
appropriated to the Secretary of Homeland Security such funds as may be 
necessary for each of fiscal years 2012 through 2016 to--
            (1) establish and operate the BEST program, including to 
        provide for operational, administrative, and technological 
        costs to Federal, State, local, tribal and foreign law 
        enforcement agencies participating in the BEST program; and
            (2) investigate, apprehend, and prosecute individuals 
        engaged in drug trafficking, arms smuggling, illegal alien
