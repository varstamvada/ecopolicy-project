                               RESOLUTION


 
Honoring Catholic Sisters for their contributions to the United States.

Whereas approximately 220,000 Catholic Sisters have served in the United States 
        beginning even before the Nation's founding;
Whereas approximately 57,000 Catholic Sisters serve in the United States today;
Whereas Catholic Sisters are women who dedicate their lives to God by serving 
        God's people, especially the poor, the sick, and the marginalized;
Whereas, fortified by a deep faith in God and an unwavering commitment to the 
        common good, American nuns built the Catholic Church in the United 
        States through their ministry to the vulnerable, the sick, and the poor;
Whereas individuals trained by the Catholic Sisters serve as health providers in 
        communities across the Nation;
Whereas Catholic hospitals treated approximately one in 6 patients in the United 
        States;
Whereas Catholic Sisters helped establish the Nation's largest private school 
        system and founded more than 150 colleges and universities and educated 
        millions of young people in the United States;
Whereas, since 1980, 9 Catholic Sisters from the United States have been 
        martyred while working for social justice and human rights overseas;
Whereas Catholic Sisters who have answered the call of the Second Vatican 
        Council to seek ``justice in the world'' continue the vital mission of 
        teaching our children in schools, healing the sick in hospitals, feeding 
        the hungry, sheltering the homeless, administering major institutions, 
        encouraging corporate responsibility, and advocating for public policies 
        that honor human dignity; and
Whereas the congregations of women religious, along with their respective 
        organizations, make the United States stronger and deserve our deepest 
        appreciation: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) recognizes and commends the Catholic Sisters of the 
        United States, whose inspiring legacy of service enriches the 
        Nation;
            (2) honors the contributions of Catholic Sisters to the 
        Nation; and
            (3) stands in solidarity with Catholic Sisters in their 
        work toward a more just society for all of God's people.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
