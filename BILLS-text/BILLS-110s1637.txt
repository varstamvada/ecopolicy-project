                structure, or facility, in whole or in part (including 
                the associated support systems of the building, 
                structure, or facility), that--
                            (i) is constructed (including facilities 
                        constructed for lease), renovated, or 
                        purchased, in whole or in part, by the 
                        Administrator for use by the Federal 
                        Government; or
                            (ii) is leased, in whole or in part, by the 
                        Administrator for use by the Federal 
                        Government--
