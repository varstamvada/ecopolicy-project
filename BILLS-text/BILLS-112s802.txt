  To authorize the Secretary of the Interior to allow the storage and 
 conveyance of nonproject water at the Norman project in Oklahoma, and 
                          for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Lake Thunderbird Efficient Use Act 
of 2011''.

SEC. 2. NORMAN PROJECT, OKLAHOMA.

    Public Law 86-529 (74 Stat. 225) is amended by adding at the end 
the following:

``SEC. 10. LAKE THUNDERBIRD.

    ``(a) In General.--If the Secretary of the Interior determines that 
there is enough excess capacity in the reservoir on the Little River 
known as `Lake Thunderbird' that nonproject water can be stored in Lake 
Thunderbird, the Secretary of the Interior may, in accordance with the 
reclamation laws, amend an existing contract, or enter into 1 or more 
new contracts, with the Central Oklahoma Master Conservancy District 
for the storage and conveyance of nonproject water in Norman project 
facilities to augment municipal and industrial supplies for the cities 
served by the Central Oklahoma Master Conservancy District.
    ``(b) Costs.--If any additional infrastructure is needed to enable 
the storage and conveyance of non-project water in Norman project 
facilities under subsection (a) or any other provision of this Act, the 
costs of constructing, operating, and maintaining the infrastructure 
shall be the responsibility of the non-Federal entity contracting with 
the Secretary of the Interior for storage and conveyance rights.''.

SEC. 3. EFFECT.

    Nothing in this Act or an amendment made by this Act authorizes any 
expansion of the storage capacity of Lake Thunderbird.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
