_______________________________________________________________________

                               RESOLUTION


 
    Honoring the 150th anniversary of Fort Sill in Lawton, Oklahoma.

Whereas January 8, 2019, marks the 150th anniversary of Fort Sill, a military 
        installation operating in the Lawton-Fort Sill region of Oklahoma;
Whereas the site of Fort Sill was staked out on January 8, 1869, by Major 
        General Philip H. Sheridan, and the garrison was first called ``Camp 
        Wichita'';
Whereas Fort Sill is named after Brigadier General Joshua W. Sill, who was 
        killed in the American Civil War and was a friend to Major General 
        Philip H. Sheridan;
Whereas the first post commander at Fort Sill was Brevet Major General Benjamin 
        Grierson;
Whereas, in 1877, Lieutenant Henry O. Flipper, the first African American to 
        graduate from West Point, was assigned to the 10th Cavalry Regiment at 
        Fort Sill;
Whereas, in 1898, the Fort Sill garrison was down to 27 officers and soldiers as 
        the cavalry left for battles in Cuba during the Spanish-American War, 
        and Lieutenant Allyn Capron, Jr., who had joined the ``Rough Riders'', 
        was the first officer killed in Cuba;
Whereas the last Indian land in Oklahoma opened for settlement in 1901, and 
        29,000 homesteaders registered at Fort Sill during July of that year for 
        the land lottery;
Whereas Fort Sill played a major role in expanding the nearby city of Lawton, 
        which was named after Major General Henry W. Lawton, a Fort Sill 
        quartermaster who was killed in the Philippines in 1899 and was a Medal 
        of Honor recipient;
Whereas, on August 6, 1901, the town of Lawton was established and quickly grew 
        to become the third largest city in Oklahoma, later becoming part of the 
        greater Lawton-Fort Sill community;
Whereas, with the disappearance of the frontier, the mission of Fort Sill 
        gradually changed from cavalry to field artillery, with the first 
        artillery battery arriving at Fort Sill in 1902, and the last cavalry 
        regiment departing in May 1907;
Whereas, the School of Fire for Field Artillery was founded at Fort Sill in 1911 
        and continues to operate as the United States Army Field Artillery 
        School;
Whereas, throughout its history, Fort Sill has served as home to--

    (1) the Infantry School of Musketry, which was later renamed the 
Infantry School and moved to Camp Benning, Georgia;

    (2) the Gas Defense School;

    (3) the School for Aerial Observers;

    (4) the Artillery Officers Candidate School (Robinson Barracks);

    (5) the Air Service Flying School;

    (6) the Army Aviation School;

    (7) the School of Fire (now known as the Field Artillery School); and

    (8) the Air Defense Artillery School;

Whereas, in 1915, the first air unit in the history of the United States Armed 
        Forces, the 1st Aero Squadron, was stationed at Fort Sill for 
        experiments in the aerial observation of artillery fire and, in 1916, 
        was sent into combat with General Jack Pershing on an expedition into 
        Mexico;
Whereas, in 1917, the Henry Post Army Airfield was constructed for aerial 
        artillery observation and spotting;
Whereas, with the start of World War I in 1918, the post expanded quickly, and 
        the Army established Camp Doniphan on the northwest edge of Fort Sill in 
        order to assemble, house, and train entire divisions before sending the 
        divisions to Europe;
Whereas, during World War I, Fort Sill found itself with a unique new training 
        mission, as the War Department was unprepared to train officers and 
        soldiers for the threat of weapons of mass destruction posed by the 
        wide-scale use of chemical weapons in Europe, and soldiers had to be 
        equipped and trained for the new threat;
Whereas the 35th Division was constituted in 1917 as 1 of the 17 National Guard 
        divisions authorized for service in World War I;
Whereas the 35th Division--

    (1) was organized from the National Guards of Kansas and Missouri;

    (2) included 3 machine gun battalions, 3 field artillery regiments, 4 
infantry regiments, 1 engineer regiment, and 1 signal battalion, with a 
total strength of 26,373 soldiers;

    (3) trained at Camp Doniphan until April 1918, when the 35th Division 
embarked to Europe;

Whereas, on September 15, 1918, the 35th Division moved to the Meuse-Argonne 
        front and, during the night of September 20, 1918, moved into forward 
        positions in preparation for the Meuse-Argonne offensive;
Whereas, on September 26, 1918, the 35th Division launched an attack and, for 
        the next 4 days, kept up the attack against heavy German resistance;
Whereas the 35th Division returned to the United States in April 1919 and was 
        demobilized on May 30, 1919;
Whereas President Harry S. Truman was a captain and battery commander of 1 of 
        the field artillery units of the 35th Division and ran a canteen at Camp 
        Doniphan for a period of time;
Whereas, after World War I, the Field Artillery School commandants began a long-
        range program to improve field artillery mobility, gunnery, and 
        equipment;
Whereas Major Carlos Brewer, the Director of the Gunnery Department in the late 
        1920s and early 1930s, introduced new fire-direction techniques so fire 
        support could be more responsive;
Whereas Major Orlando Ward, the next Director of the Gunnery Department after 
        Major Carlos Brewer, developed the fire direction center to centralize 
        command and control and to facilitate massing fire;
Whereas Major Brewer, Major Ward, and Lieutenant Colonel H.L.C. Jones encouraged

Whereas the Field Artillery Officer Candidate School at Fort Sill--

    (1) was opened by the Army in 1941 to help meet the need for leaders in 
a rapidly expanding Army;

    (2) was closed during the peace period between World War II and the 
Korean War;

    (3) was subsequently reopened and remained open until 1973; and

    (4) trained 57,500 field artillery officers for World War II, the 
Korean War, and the Vietnam War;

Whereas 2 Field Artillery Officer Candidate School graduates, First Lieutenant 
        James E. Robinson (Class of 62-43) and Second Lieutenant Harold B. 
        Durham, Jr. (Class of 1-67), were awarded the Medal of Honor;

Commerce;

    (2) Martin R. Hoffman (Class of 71-55), a former Secretary of the Army;

    (3) from late January to March 1945, held defensive positions before 
driving west with the 26th Infantry Division through Germany, finishing the 
war just inside the Czech border at Kienberg;

Whereas, to best use new long-range guns and improve response times, the Field 
        Artillery School championed the use of organic air observation to 
        control field artillery fires, with the War Department approving organic 
        field artillery air observation in 1942 and the field artillery air 
        observers adjusting massed fire and performing liaison, reconnaissance, 
        and other missions during World War II;
Whereas, in 1942, Fort Sill stood down the last horse-drawn field artillery 
        unit, ending 73 years of the partnership between soldiers and horses 
        that helped fuel the military strength of Fort Sill;
Whereas horses did not reappear at Fort Sill until 1963, when the commanding 
        general authorized a special ``Half Section of Field Artillery'', which 
        names the horses after Fort Sill commanders;
Whereas, on July 10, 1943, the 45th Infantry Division, which trained at Fort 
        Sill and was known as the ``Thunderbirds'', participated in its first of

        Gene Autry making numerous trips to entertain the troops there;
Whereas Louis L'Amor, before becoming a writer of western novels, was a boxing 
        instructor at the famous Artillery Bowl at Fort Sill in 1943;
Whereas, following World War II, Fort Sill adapted to the atomic age and the 
        Cold War, and the War Department consolidated all artillery training and 
        development under the United States Army Artillery Center at Fort Sill 
        in 1946;
Whereas the 45th Infantry Division ``Thunderbirds''--

    (1) deployed to South Korea in 1952;

    (2) was 1 of only 2 National Guard divisions to see combat in the 
Korean War;

    (3) was deployed with I Corps and participated in such battles as Old 
Baldy and Pork Chop Hill; and

    (4) participated in 4 campaigns during 429 days in battle;

Whereas, during the Cold War, the 4th Battalion 31st Infantry ``Polar Bears'' 
        was activated at Fort Sill to help train artillerymen in joint-combat 
        tactics;
Whereas, although the Polar Bears unit was called ``infantry'', it was a unique 
        combined-arms team that included an armored tank company;
Whereas the high-profile Polar Bears unit participated in combined-arms live-
        fire exercises (the ``CALFEX program''), which brought together 
        infantry, armor, field artillery, and Air Force assets;
Whereas the CALFEX program was brought to an end by the drive for efficient use 
        of money, with the end of the Polar Bears unit signaling the end of the 
        high-profile CALFEX program;
Whereas, as of 2019, the Polar Bears unit has been reactivated with the 10th 
        Mountain Division at Fort Drum, New York;
Whereas, in 1963, the Field Artillery School tested aerial rocket artillery, 
        which equipped helicopters with rockets;
Whereas, as demonstrated during the Vietnam War, aerial rocket artillery was 
        effective;
Whereas the Field Artillery School cooperated in the development of the Field 
        Artillery Digital Automated Computer, which was introduced in 1966 to 
        compute fire direction data and made the Field Artillery a leader in 
        computer developments for the Army;
Whereas, in 1963, the 1st Aerial Artillery Group (Provisional) was organized at 
        Fort Sill to test equipping CH-34 helicopters with rocket pods attached 
        to each side, converting the transport aircraft, an easy target in most 
        combat situations, into flying weapons capable of direct or indirect 
        fires;
Whereas modern helicopter gunships are descendants of the 1963 test program at 
        Fort Sill;
