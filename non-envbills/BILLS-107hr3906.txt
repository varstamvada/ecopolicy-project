    (b) Exception to the Penalties for Failure To Depart.--An alien 
permitted by the Attorney General to depart voluntarily shall not be 
made ineligible for any relief under the Immigration and Nationality 
Act by virtue of remaining in the United States after the scheduled 
date of departure if--

        1, 1997; and
            (2) the alien was a qualifying relative of a Philippine 
        enlistee on such scheduled date of departure and is such a 
        qualifying relative at the time of the application for relief.
    (c) Work Authorization.--The Attorney General shall provide 
qualifying relatives of Philippine enlistees of suitable age with work 
authorization (including an ``employment authorized'' endorsement or

                enlistment (or reenlistment, if the individual's 
                enlistment in the United States Navy was pursuant to 
                such Agreement) and is in good standing with honorable 
                service.
            (2) Verification of status.--In determining whether an 
        alien is a Philippine enlistee, the Attorney General and the 
        Secretary of State shall request from the Secretary of Defense, 
        through the Department of the Navy, verification of such 
        alien's date of enlistment under such Agreement, the term of
