                   IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES

                             April 2, 2008

     Mr. Inhofe (for himself and Mr. Dodd) submitted the following 
             resolution; which was considered and agreed to

_______________________________________________________________________

                               RESOLUTION


 
 Designating April 8, 2008, as ``National Cushing's Syndrome Awareness 
                                 Day''.

Whereas Cushing's Syndrome affects an estimated 10 to 15 people per 1,000,000 
        people annually, most of those affected are between the ages of 20 and 
        50;
Whereas Cushing's Syndrome is an endocrine or hormonal disorder caused by the 
        prolonged exposure of the body's tissue to high levels of the hormone 
        cortisol;
Whereas exposure to cortisol can occur by overproduction of cortisol in the body 
        or by taking glucocorticoid hormones, which are routinely prescribed for 
        asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, and lupus, or as an immunosuppressant 
        following organ transplants;
Whereas Cushing's Syndrome may also result from pituitary adenomas, ectopic 
        adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) syndrome, adrenal tumors, and 
        Familial Cushing's Syndrome;
Whereas Cushing's Syndrome can cause abnormal weight gain, skin changes, and 
        fatigue and can ultimately lead to diabetes, high blood pressure, 
        depression, osteoporosis, or death;
Whereas Cushing's Syndrome is diagnosed through a series of tests, often 
        requiring x-ray examinations of adrenal or pituitary glands to locate 
        tumors;
Whereas many people who suffer from Cushing's Syndrome are misdiagnosed or go 
        undiagnosed for years because many of the symptoms of Cushing's Syndrom 
        are also indications of milder diseases, and those errors in diagnoses 
        delay the implementation of important treatment options;
Whereas treatments for Cushing's Syndrome include surgery, radiation, 
        chemotherapy, the use of cortisol-inhibiting drugs, and reducing the 
        dosage of glucocorticoid hormones;
Whereas Cushing's Syndrome was discovered by Dr. Harvey Williams Cushing, who 
        was born on April 8, 1869;
Whereas the Dr. Harvey Cushing stamp was part of the United States Postal 
        Service's ``Great American'' series of stamps, initiated in 1980 to 
        recognize individuals for making significant contributions to the 
        heritage and culture of the United States;
Whereas President Ronald Reagan spoke on April 8, 1987, in the Rose Garden at a 
        White House ceremony to unveil the commemorative stamp honoring Dr. 
        Harvey Cushing;
Whereas, following the ceremony, President Reagan hosted a reception in the 
        State Dining Room for Mrs. John Hay Whitney, Dr. Cushing's daughter, and 
        representatives of the American Association of Neurological Surgeons; 
        and
Whereas the Senate is an institution that can raise awareness of Cushing's 
        Syndrome in the general public and the medical community: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates April 8, 2008, as ``National Cushing's 
        Syndrome Awareness Day'';
            (2) recognizes that all people in the United States should 
        become more informed and aware of Cushing's Syndrome;
            (3) calls upon the people of the United States to observe 
        the date with appropriate ceremonies and activities; and
            (4) directs the Secretary of the Senate to transmit a copy 
        of this resolution to the Cushing's Understanding, Support, and 
        Help Organization.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
