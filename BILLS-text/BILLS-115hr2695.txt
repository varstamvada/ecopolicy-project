 To establish an Office of Environmental Justice in the Environmental 
   Protection Agency and to authorize an environmental justice small 
                grants program, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Environmental Justice Small Grants 
Program Act of 2017''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Despite Executive Order 12898 (relating to ``Federal 
        Actions to Address Environmental Justice in Minority 
        Populations and Low-Income Populations''), communities of 
        color, low income communities, people with limited English 
        proficiency, indigenous peoples, and people living with 
        disabilities experience the impacts of climate change at a 
        disproportionate rate.
            (2) The Environmental Protection Agency formed the 
        Environmental Justice Small Grants Program to support and 
        empower frontline communities that are working on solutions to 
        the disproportionate impacts of climate change.
            (3) Between 2000 and 2015, the Environmental Protection 
        Agency, through the Environmental Justice Small Grants Program, 
        awarded more than 630 small grants to assist with the cost of 
        conducting research and education, as well as developing 
        community-based solutions.

Office of Environmental Justice, which shall be headed by a Director.
