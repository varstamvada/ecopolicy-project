_______________________________________________________________________

                                 A BILL


 
        To protect children through eliminating visa loopholes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Protecting Children Through 
Eliminating Visa Loopholes Act''.

SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the laws of the United States and the policies of the 
        Department of State aim to prevent and reduce the risks of 
        child marriages, sex trafficking, and sexual abuse occurring 
        throughout the world;
            (2) major loopholes in Federal law have allowed up to 
        thousands of minors to be subjected to child marriages;
            (3) under the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 
        1101 et seq.)--
                    (A) a United States citizen child may petition for 
                an immigrant visa for a spouse or fiance living in 
                another country; and
                    (B) a United States citizen adult may petition for 
                an immigrant visa for a minor spouse or fiance living 
                abroad;
            (4) the United States Government has advocated for 
        preventing and reducing the occurrence of child marriages 
        throughout the world;
            (5) Congress passed the Violence Against Women 
        Reauthorization Act of 2013 (Public Law 113-4), which requires 
        the Secretary of State to establish and implement a multiyear 
        strategy--
                    (A) to ``prevent child marriages''; and
                    (B) to ``promote the empowerment of girls at risk 
                of child marriage in developing countries'';
            (6) acknowledges that although the Federal Government is 
        limited in its ability to address child marriage within 
        individual States, establishing a minimum age of 18 years for 
        marriage-based and fiance-based immigrant visa petitions is an 
        immediate and viable solution for preventing child marriage 
        through exploitation of the United States immigration system;
            (7) affirms that child well being is a foremost priority 
        and consideration when imposing strict age requirements for 
        visa spousal and fiance petitions within the United States 
        immigration system; and
            (8) recognizes that under the current immigration legal 
        framework, individuals may exploit visa marriage and fiance 
        petitions for nefarious purposes, including--
                    (A) coercing forced marriages; and
                    (B) the trafficking and abuse of children.

SEC. 3. PROTECTING CHILDREN THROUGH ELIMINATING VISA LOOPHOLES.

    (a) Definitions.--Section 101(a) of the Immigration and Nationality 
Act (8 U.S.C. 1101(a)) is amended--

                section 214, an alien who is at least 18 years of 
                age''; and
                    (B) by inserting ``who is at least 18 years of 
                age'' after ``a citizen of the United States'' each 
                time such term appears; and
            (2) in paragraph (35), by adding at the end the following: 
        ``Such terms do not include any individual who is younger than 
        18 years of age or who is married to an individual who is

                permanent residence based upon a grant of conditional 
                lawful permanent resident status before such date of 
                enactment.
