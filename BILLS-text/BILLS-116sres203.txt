                               RESOLUTION


 
  Recognizing the 80th anniversary of the Aircraft Owners and Pilots 
                              Association.

Whereas on May 15, 2019, the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association (referred to 
        in this preamble as ``AOPA''), will celebrate 80 years of successfully 
        representing the interests of general aviation pilots and private 
        aircraft ownership across the United States;
Whereas AOPA was formed on May 15, 1939, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in the 
        years leading up to the entry of the United States into World War II;
Whereas AOPA has grown into the largest aviation association in the world;
Whereas AOPA has an ongoing legacy of successfully representing the interests of 
        general aviation pilots and private aircraft owners across the United 
        States;
Whereas general aviation plays an important role in the economic vitality of 
        communities across the United States, creating jobs and opportunities 
        for growth throughout the United States;
Whereas approximately 5,000 public-use airports and 15,000 other landing 
        facilities support the United States general aviation fleet of nearly 
        200,000 aircraft and approximately 600,000 pilots;
Whereas AOPA tirelessly advocates for and contributes to improving the safety of 
        aviation;
Whereas AOPA is committed to growing the pilot population by introducing young 
        people to career opportunities and welcoming more women and minorities 
        into aviation;
Whereas in the 80 years since AOPA was formed the organization has been led by 
        only 5 presidents: Joseph B. ``Doc'' Hartranft, John L. Baker, Philip B. 
        Boyer, Craig L. Fuller, and Mark R. Baker; and
Whereas AOPA remains committed to protecting and promoting aviation in the 
        United States: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate, on the occasion of the 80th anniversary 
of the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association, recognizes the efforts 
of the association in--
            (1) helping to ensure the freedom to fly; and
            (2) leaving a lasting legacy for future generations of 
        aviators.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
