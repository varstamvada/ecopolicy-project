                               RESOLUTION


 
 Commending Oklahoma State University's wrestling team for winning the 
  2005 National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I Wrestling 
                             Championship.

Whereas on March 19, 2005, the Oklahoma State University Cowboys claimed their 
        33rd National Collegiate Athletic Association Wrestling Championship in 
        St. Louis, Missouri;
Whereas the 33 wrestling championships won by the Cowboys is more than have been 
        won by any other school in the history of National Collegiate Athletic 
        Association Division I wrestling;
Whereas the Cowboys now have won 3 consecutive wrestling championships, a feat 
        not accomplished since they won the national wrestling championship in 
        1954, 1955, and 1956;
Whereas the Cowboys' 2005 championship topped off an impressive season in which 
        they were undefeated in the regular season and also had a perfect record 
        in the finals;
Whereas the Cowboys outscored second place Michigan, 153 to 83, achieving a 
        margin of victory that was the second-highest in National Collegiate 
        Athletic Association wrestling history;
Whereas the Cowboys crowned a school-record 5 individual national champions, 
        tying a national tournament record;
Whereas the Cowboys' outstanding 2005 season contributed to an already rich and 
        proud tradition of wrestling excellence at Oklahoma State University;
Whereas the amazing accomplishments of the past year reflect the dedication, 
        commitment, and tireless effort of the entire school, from the president 
        to the athletic directors, coaches, athletes, managers, and staff 
        members; and
Whereas the student athletes of the Oklahoma State University wrestling team, 
        through their exceptional athletic achievements, have not only brought 
        credit to themselves but to their fellow students, their university, and 
        their community: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) commends the Oklahoma State Cowboys for their third 
        straight National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I 
        Wrestling Championship;
            (2) recognizes the players, coaches, staff, and all who 
        have made the historic successes of the 2005 season possible; 
        and
            (3) directs the Secretary of the Senate to transmit an 
        enrolled copy of this resolution to Oklahoma State University 
        President Dr. David J. Schmidly and Coach John Smith for 
        appropriate display.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
