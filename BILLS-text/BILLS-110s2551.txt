SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSES.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) progress toward the safe disposal of spent nuclear fuel 
        and high-level radioactive waste will help ensure that the 
        expanded use of nuclear energy will contribute to meeting the 
        growing need of the United States for reliable, cost-effective 
        energy;
            (2) the Federal Government has the responsibility to 
        provide for permanent disposal of spent nuclear fuel, high-
        level radioactive waste, and waste generated from United States 
        atomic energy defense activities;
            (3) the obligation of the Federal Government to develop a 
        repository provides sufficient grounds for findings by the 
        Nuclear Regulatory Commission that spent nuclear fuel and high-
        level radioactive waste will be disposed of safely and in a 
        timely manner;
            (4) the electricity consumers and nuclear power plant 
        operators of the United States have paid in excess of 
        $27,000,000,000 in fees and interest to fund disposal of spent 
        nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste;
            (5) the National Research Council of the National Academy 
        of Sciences--
                    (A) since 1957, has endorsed the concept of deep 
                geologic disposal of high-level radioactive waste as a 
                long-term solution based on scientific and technical 
                analysis; and
                    (B) maintains that deep geologic disposal remains 
                as the only long-term solution available for the 
                disposal of high-level radioactive waste;
            (6) in 2002, the Yucca Mountain site was recommended by the 
        President and approved by Congress for development as a deep 
        geologic repository;
            (7) operation of a repository in accordance with the 
        Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 (42 U.S.C. 10101 et seq.) is 
        nearly 20 years behind schedule;
            (8) the delay has--
                    (A) resulted in judicial findings of a partial 
                breach of contract on the part of the Federal 
                Government; and
                    (B) subjected taxpayers to billions of dollars in 
                liability;
            (9) the Commission should allow the upgrade of non-nuclear 
        infrastructure at the repository site prior to construction in 
        an effort to accelerate progress and reduce taxpayer liability;
            (10) the repository should be licensed to safely use the 
        maximum potential capacity of the repository, based on 
        scientific and technical considerations; and
            (11) the development of the repository should incorporate 
        technological advances to improve protection of public health 
        and safety and the environment on a regular basis while 
        retaining the option of retrieval.
    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--
            (1) to encourage the expanded contribution of nuclear 
        energy to meet the growing need of the United States for safe, 
        reliable, and cost-effective energy;
            (2) to provide a process for the expeditious and safe 
        development and operation of a repository at the Yucca Mountain 
        site;
            (3) to require periodic system improvements based on 
        advances in technology and understanding to enhance the 
        protection of public health and safety and the environment;
            (4) to clarify the authority of the Secretary to carry out 
        infrastructure activities without prejudicing the consideration 
        of the Commission with respect to repository applications; and
            (5) to provide guidance to the Commission with respect to 
        the consideration by the Commission of spent nuclear fuel and 
        high-level waste disposal during new reactor licensing 
        proceedings.
