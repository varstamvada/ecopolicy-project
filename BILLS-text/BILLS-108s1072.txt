and national and civil defense.
    ``It is further declared that it is in the national interest to 
preserve and enhance the Dwight D. Eisenhower National System of 
Interstate and Defense Highways (hereafter referred to as the 
``Interstate System'') to meet the nation's needs for the 21st Century. 
Urban and long distance personal travel and freight movement demands 
continue to grow. Travel demand patterns will remain dynamic. Continued 
planning for and investment in the Interstate System is critical to 
assure it adequately meets the changing travel demands of the future. 
The Interstate System must be safe, efficient, and reliable and must 
ensure national and interregional personal mobility, the flow of 
interstate commerce, and travel movements essential for national 
security. To the maximum extent possible, actions under this title 
should address congestion and freight transportation to provide for a 
strong and vigorous national economy. Special emphasis should be 
devoted to providing safe and efficient access for the type and size of 
commercial and military vehicles that access designated National 
Highway System intermodal freight terminals.
    ``The Interstate System is further declared to be the nation's 
premiere highway system, essential for the nation's economic vitality, 
national security, and general welfare. The Secretary is directed to 
take appropriate actions to preserve and enhance the Interstate System 
to meet the needs of the 21st Century.''.

related to surface transportation that the Secretary determines to be 
appropriate.

infrastructure bank under this section, each State establishing the 
bank shall--
            (1) contribute, at a minimum, into each account of the bank 
        from non-Federal sources an amount equal to 25 percent of the

        non-Federal share under section 120(d) of title 23, as amended 
        by this Act, such percentage shall be adjusted by the Secretary 
        to correspond with such lower non-Federal share. The non-
        Federal share must be in the form of cash;
            (2) ensure that the bank maintains on a continuing basis an

                bank deposits, or such other financing instruments as 
                the Secretary may approve to earn interest to enhance 
                the leveraging of projects assisted by the bank;
            (4) ensure that any loan from the bank will bear interest 
        at or below market interest rates, as determined by the State, 
        to make feasible the project that is the subject of the loan;
            (5) ensure that repayment of any loan from the bank will 
        commence not later than 5 years after the project has been 
        completed or, in the case of a highway project, the facility 
        has opened to traffic, whichever is later;
            (6) ensure that the term for repaying any loan will not 
        exceed 30 years after the date of the first payment on the loan

        that would otherwise apply to funds made available under such 
        title and projects assisted with such funds apply to--
                    (A) funds made available under such title and 
                contributed to an infrastructure bank established under 
                this section; and
                    (B) projects assisted by the bank through the use 
                of such funds; except to the extent that the Secretary 
                determines that any requirement of such title (other 
                than sections 113 and 114 of title 23 and section 5333 
                of title 49), is not consistent with the objectives of 
                this section; and
            (2) specify procedures and guidelines for establishing, 
        operating, and providing assistance from the bank.
    (i) Applicability of Federal Law to Repayments.--The requirements 
of title 23 and title 49, United States Code, shall apply to projects 
financed from repayments to an infrastructure bank from projects 
assisted by the bank. Such repayments shall be considered to be Federal 
funds for the purpose of this subsection.
    (j) United States Not Obligated.--The contribution of Federal funds 
into an infrastructure bank established under this section shall not be 
construed as a commitment, guarantee, or obligation on the part of the 
United States to any third party, nor shall any third party have any 
right against the United States for payment solely by virtue of the 
contribution. Any security or debt-financing instrument issued by the 
infrastructure bank shall expressly state that the security or 
instrument does not constitute a commitment, guarantee, or obligation 
of the United States.
    (k) Management of Federal Funds.--Sections 3335 and 6503 of title

contributed to an infrastructure bank established by the State under

This limitation shall not apply to non-Federal funds.

SEC. 1602. EFFICIENT ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEWS FOR PROJECT DECISIONMAKING.

    (a) Policy and Purpose.--
            (1) Policy.--The Enlibra principles, as initially developed 
        by the Western Governors Association and adopted by the 
        National Governors Association, represent a sound basis for 
        interaction among the Federal, State, local governments, and 
        tribes on environmental matters and should be followed to the 
        maximum extent practicable in the development of highway 
        construction and public transit improvements. These principles 
        are:
                    (A) Assign responsibilities at the right level.
                    (B) Use collaborative processes to break down 
                barriers and find solutions.
                    (C) Move to a performance-based system.
                    (D) Separate subjective choices from objective data 
                gathering.
                    (E) Pursue economic incentives whenever 
                appropriate.
                    (F) Ensure environmental understanding.
                    (G) Make sure environmental decisions are fully 
                informed.
                    (H) Use appropriate geographic boundaries for 
                environmental problems.
            (2) Purpose.--The purpose of this section is to reduce 
        delays in the delivery of highway construction and public 
        transit projects arising from the environmental review process, 
        while continuing to ensure the protection of the human and 
        natural environment.
    (b) Coordinated Environmental Review Process.--
            (1) Development and implementation.--The Secretary shall 
        develop and implement a coordinated environmental review 
        process for highway construction and public transit projects 
        that require--
                    (A) the preparation of an environmental impact 
                statement or environmental assessment under the 
                National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 
                4321 et seq.), except that the Secretary may decide not 
                to apply this section to the preparation of an 
                environmental assessment under such Act; or
                    (B) the conduct of any other environmental review 
                or analysis, rendering of an opinion, or issuance of an 
                environmental permit, license, or approval under 
                Federal law.
            (2) Memorandum of understanding.--
                    (A) In general.--The coordinated environmental 
                review process may be specified for a particular 
                project, class of projects, or program and shall ensure 
                that, whenever practicable (as specified in this 
                section), all environmental reviews, analyses, 
                opinions, and any permits, licenses, or approvals that 
                must be issued or made by any Federal agency for the 
                project concerned shall be conducted concurrently and 
                completed within a cooperatively determined time 
                period. Such process for a project, class of projects, 
                or program may be incorporated into a memorandum of 
                understanding between the Department of Transportation 
                and affected Federal agencies (and, where appropriate, 
                State and local agencies and federally recognized 
                tribes).
                    (B) Establishment of time periods.--In establishing 
                the time period referred to in subparagraph (A), and 
                any time periods for review within such period, the 
                Department and all such agencies shall take into 
                account their respective resources and statutory 
                commitments.
    (c) Elements of Coordinated Environmental Review Process.--For each 
project, the coordinated environmental review process established under 
this section shall provide, at a minimum, for the following elements:
            (1) Federal agency identification.--The Secretary shall, at 
        the earliest possible time, identify all potential Federal 
        agencies that--
                    (A) have jurisdiction by law over or special 
                expertise related to environmental-related issues that 
                may be affected by the project and the analysis of 
                which would be part of any environmental document 
                required by the National Environmental Policy Act of 
                1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.); or
                    (B) may be required by Federal law to 
                independently--
                            (i) conduct an environmental-related review 
                        or analysis for the project;
                            (ii) determine whether to issue a permit, 
                        license, or approval for the project; or
                            (iii) render an opinion on the 
                        environmental impact of the project.
            (2) Time limitations and concurrent review.--If requested 
        by the project sponsor, the Secretary and the head of each 
        Federal agency identified under paragraph (1)--
                    (A)(i) shall jointly develop and establish time 
                periods for review for--
                            (I) all Federal agency comments with 
                        respect to any environmental documents required 
                        by the National Environmental Policy Act of 
                        1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.) for the project; 
                        and
                            (II) all other independent Federal agency 
                        environmental analyses, reviews, opinions, and 
                        decisions on any permits, licenses, and 
                        approvals that must be issued or made for the 
                        project; such that each such Federal agency's 
                        review shall be undertaken and completed within 
                        such established time periods for review; or
                    (ii) may enter into an agreement to establish such 
                time periods for review with respect to a class of 
                projects or programs; and
                    (B) shall ensure, in establishing such time periods 
                for review, that the conduct of any such analysis or 
                review, rendering of such opinion, and the issuance of 
                such decision is undertaken concurrently with all other 
                environmental reviews for the project, including the 
                reviews required by the National Environmental Policy 
                Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.); except that such 
                review may not be concurrent if the affected Federal 
                agency can demonstrate that such concurrent review 
                would result in a significant adverse impact to the 
                environment or substantively alter the operation of 
                Federal law or would not be possible without 
                information developed as part of the environmental 
                review process.
            (3) Factors to be considered.--Time periods for review 
        established under this section shall be consistent with the 
        time periods established by the Council on Environmental 
        Quality under sections 1501.8 and 1506.10 of title 40, Code of 
        Federal Regulations.
            (4) Extensions.--The Secretary shall extend any time 
        periods for review under this section if, upon good cause 
        shown, the Secretary and any Federal agency concerned determine 
        that additional time for analysis and review is needed. Any 
        memorandum of understanding shall be modified to incorporate 
        any mutually agreed-upon extensions.
    (d) Clarification Regarding Environmental Impact Statements 
Prepared by State and Local Transportation Agencies.--Any project 
sponsor that is a State or local governmental entity eligible to 
receive funds under this Act, chapter I of title 23, United States 
Code; or chapter 53 of title 49, United States Code, may, at the 
discretion of the Secretary, serve as a joint lead agency with the 
Department for purposes of preparing any environmental document under 
the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended (42 U.S.C. 
4321, et seq.), and may prepare any such environmental documents 
required in support of any action or approval by the Secretary, 
provided that the Department furnishes guidance in such preparation and 
independently evaluates such document, and provided that the document 
is approved and adopted by the Secretary prior to the Secretary taking 
any subsequent action or making any approval based on such document, 
whether or not the Secretary's action or approval results in Federal 
funding. The Secretary shall ensure that the project sponsor complies 
with all design and mitigation commitments made jointly by the 
Secretary and the project sponsor in such environmental document, or 
that the document is appropriately supplemented if project changes 
become necessary. Any such environmental document prepared in 
accordance with this subsection may be adopted or used by any Federal 
agency making any approval to the same extent that such Federal agency 
could adopt or use a document prepared by another Federal agency.
    (e) Dispute Resolution.--When the Secretary determines that a 
Federal agency which is subject to a time period under this section for 
its environmental review has failed to complete its review, analysis, 
opinion, or decision on issuing any permit, license, or approval within 
the established time period or within any agreed-upon extension to such 
time period, the Secretary may, after notice and consultation with such 
agency, close the record on the matter before the Secretary. If the 
Secretary finds, after timely compliance with this section, that an 
environmental issue related to the project over which an affected 
Federal agency has jurisdiction under Federal law has not been 
resolved, the Secretary and the head of the Federal agency shall 
resolve the matter not later than 30 days after the date of the finding 
by the Secretary. The dispute resolution procedures established 
pursuant to this subsection may be initiated by the Secretary or by the 
Governor of any State in which a highway construction or public transit 
project is located, or by the head of any Federal agency subject to the 
time period under this subsection.
    (f) Participation of State Agencies.--For any project eligible for 
assistance under chapter 1 of title 23, United States Code, a State, 
under State law, may require that all State agencies that have 
jurisdiction by State or Federal law over environmental-related issues 
that may be affected by the project, or that are required to issue any 
environmental-related reviews, analyses, opinions, or determinations on 
issuing any permits, licenses, or approvals for the project, be subject 
to the coordinated environmental review process established under this 
section unless the Secretary determines that a State agency's 
participation would not be in the public interest. If a State wishes to 
participate in the review process, the State must require all such 
State agencies with jurisdiction by law to be subject to and comply 
with the review process to the same extent as a Federal agency.
    (g) Assistance to Affected State and Federal Agencies.--
            (1) In general.--The Secretary may approve a request by a 
        State to provide funds made available under chapter 1 of title 
        23, United States Code, or for a public transit project made 
        available under chapter 53 of title 49, United States Code, to 
        the State for the project, class of projects, or program 
        subject to the coordinated environmental review process 
        established under this section, to affected Federal agencies, 
        including the Department of Transportation, to State agencies 
        participating in the coordinated environmental review process, 
        and to federally recognized tribes, to provide the resources 
        necessary to meet any time limits established under this 
        section. The Secretary also may use funds made available under 
        section 204 of title 23, United States Code, for the purposes 
        specified under this subsection.
            (2) Amounts.--Such requests under paragraph (1) shall be 
        approved only--
                    (A) for the additional amounts that the Secretary 
                determines are necessary for the affected Federal 
                agencies to meet the time limits for environmental 
                review; and
                    (B) if such time limits are less than the customary 
                time necessary for such review.
    (h) Judicial Review and Savings Clause.--
            (1) Judicial review.--Except as set forth under subsection 
        (i), nothing in this section shall affect the reviewability of 
        any final Federal agency action in a court of the United 
        States.
            (2) Savings clause.--Nothing in this section shall affect 
        the applicability of the National Environmental Policy Act of 
        1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.) or any other Federal 
        environmental statute or affect the responsibility of any 
        Federal officer to comply with or enforce any such statute.
    (i) Limitations on Claims.--Notwithstanding any other provision of 
law, a claim arising under Federal law seeking judicial review of a 
permit, license, or approval issued by a Federal agency for a highway 
construction or public transit project shall be barred unless it is 
filed within one hundred eighty days after the permit, license, or 
approval is final pursuant to the statute under which the agency action 
is taken, unless a shorter time is specified in the Federal law 
pursuant to which judicial review is allowed. Nothing in this 
subsection shall create a right to judicial review or place any limit 
on filing a claim that a person has violated the terms of a permit, 
license, or approval.
    (j) Repeal.--Section 1309 of the Transportation Equity Act for the 
21st Century (Public Law 105-178; 112 Stat. 232; June 9, 1998) is 
repealed.

SEC. 1603. ASSUMPTION OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR CATEGORICAL EXCLUSIONS.

    (a) General.--Section 138 of title 23, United States Code, is 
repealed and the following new section is inserted:
''Sec. 138. Assumption of responsibility for categorical exclusions
    ``(a) Categorical Exclusion Determinations.--Upon mutual agreement, 
the Secretary may assign and a State may assume responsibility for 
determining whether certain designated activities are included within 
classes of action identified in regulation by the Secretary that are 
categorically excluded from requirements for environmental assessments 
or environmental impact statements pursuant to regulations promulgated 
by the Council on Environmental Quality, or other successor law or 
regulation. Such determinations shall be made by a State pursuant to 
criteria established by the Secretary and only for types of activities 
specifically designated by the Secretary. Such criteria shall include 
provision for public availability of information consistent with the 
Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552).
    ``(b) Other Applicable Federal Laws.--Upon mutual agreement, the 
Secretary may assign and the State may assume some or all of the 
Department's responsibilities for environmental review, consultation, 
or other related actions required under any Federal law applicable to 
activities that are classified by the Secretary as categorical 
exclusions, with the exception of government-to-government consultation 
with Indian tribes, if the State also assumes decision-making authority 
under this section. The State shall assume this responsibility subject 
to the same procedural and substantive requirements as would be 
required if that responsibility was carried out by the Department. When 
a State assumes such responsibility under a Federal law, it shall be 
solely responsible and solely liable for complying with and carrying 
out that law in lieu of the Department.
    ``(c) Agreements.--The Secretary and the State shall enter into a 
memorandum of understanding setting forth the responsibilities to be 
assigned under this section and the terms and conditions under which 
such assignments are to be made. Such memorandums of understanding 
shall be established for periods of no more than three years. In the 
memorandum of understanding the State shall consent to accept the 
jurisdiction of the Federal courts for the compliance, discharge, and 
enforcement of any responsibility of the Secretary it may assume. The 
Secretary shall monitor the State department of transportation's 
compliance with the memorandum of understanding as well as the 
effectiveness of the delegation, and will take into account the State's 
performance in deciding whether and under what conditions to renew a 
memorandum of understanding.
    ``(d) Termination.--The Secretary may terminate any assumption of 
responsibility under this section upon a determination that a State is 
not adequately carrying out its assigned responsibilities.
    ``(e) State Subject to Federal Laws.--For purposes of assuming 
theSecretary's responsibilities under this section, the State agency 
signing the agreement in subsection (c) is deemed to be a Federal 
agency to the extent the State is carrying out the Secretary's 
responsibilities under the National Environmental Policy Act, under 
this title, and under any other Federal law.''.
    (b) Conforming Amendment.--The analysis of chapter 1 of title 23 is 
amended by striking ``Preservation of parklands'' in the item relating 
to section 138 and inserting ``Assumption of responsibility for 
categorical exclusions.''.

SEC. 1604. SECTION 4(F) POLICY ON LANDS, WILDLIFE AND WATERFOWL 
              REFUGES, AND HISTORIC SITES.

    Section 303 of title 49, United States Code, is amended to read as 
follows:
Sec. 303. Policy on lands, wildlife and waterfowl refuges, and historic 
              sites
    ``(a) It is the policy of the United States Government that special 
effort should be made to preserve the natural beauty of the countryside 
and public park and recreation lands, wildlife and waterfowl refuges, 
and historic sites.
    ``(b) The Secretary of Transportation shall cooperate and consult, 
when appropriate, with the Secretaries of the Interior, Housing and 
Urban Development, and Agriculture, and with the States, in developing 
transportation plans and programs that include measures to maintain or 
enhance the natural beauty of lands crossed by transportation 
activities or facilities.
    ``(c)(1) The Secretary of Transportation may approve a 
transportation program or project requiring the use of publicly owned 
land of a public park, recreation area, or wildlife and waterfowl 
refuge of national, State, or local significance, or land of a historic 
site of national, State, or local significance (as determined by the 
Federal, State, or local officials having jurisdiction over the park, 
area, refuge or site) only if--
            ``(A) there is no feasible and prudent alternative to using 
        that land, and
            ``(B) the program or project includes all possible planning 
        to minimize harm to the park, recreation area, wildlife and 
        waterfowl refuge, or historic site resulting from the use.
    ``(2) In making approvals under this subsection, the Secretary 
shall apply the following standards:
            ``(A) The Secretary may eliminate an alternative as 
        infeasible if the Secretary finds that the alternative cannot 
        be implemented as a matter of sound engineering.
            ``(B) The Secretary shall consider the following when 
        determining whether it would be prudent to avoid the use of 
        land of a resource subject to preservation under this section:
                    ``(i) The relative significance of the land of the 
                resource being protected.
                    ``(ii) The views of the official or officials with 
                jurisdiction over the land.
                    ``(iii) The relative severity of the adverse 
                effects on the protected activities, attributes, or 
                features that qualify a resource for protection.
                    ``(iv) The ability to mitigate adverse effects.
                    ``(v) The magnitude of the adverse effects that 
                would result from the selection of an alternative that 
                avoids the use of the land of the resource.
            ``(C) A mitigation measure or mitigation alternative under 
        paragraph (c)(1)(B) of this section is possible if it is 
        feasible and prudent. In evaluating the feasibility and 
        prudence of a mitigation measure or mitigation alternative 
        under paragraph (c)(1)(B) of this section, the Secretary shall 
        be governed by the standards of paragraphs (c)(2)(A) and (B) of 
        this subsection.
    ``(d) The requirements of this section do not apply to--
            ``(1) a project for a park road, parkway, or refuge road 
        under section 204 of title 23; or
            ``(2) a highway project on land administered by an agency 
        of the Federal government, when the purpose of the project is 
        to serve or enhance the values for which the land would 
        otherwise be protected under this section, as jointly 
        determined by the Secretary of Transportation and the head of 
        the appropriate Federal land managing agency.
    ``(e) The requirements of this section are deemed to be satisfied 
where the treatment of an historic site (other than a National Historic 
Landmark) has been agreed upon in accordance with Section 106 of the 
National Historic Preservation Act (16 U.S.C. 470f). The Secretary, in 
consultation with the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, shall 
develop administrative procedures to review the implementation of this 
subsection to ensure that the objectives of the National Historic 
Preservation Act are being met.
    ``(f)(1) The Secretary may approve a request by a State to provide 
funds made available under chapter 1 of title 23, United States Code, 
to a State historic preservation office, Tribal historic preservation 
office, or to the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation to provide 
the resources necessary to expedite the historic preservation review 
and consultation process under section 303 of title 49 and under 
section 470f of title 16, United States Code.
    ``(2) The Secretary shall encourage States to provide such funding 
to State historic preservation officers, tribal historic preservation 
officers or the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation where the 
investment of such funds will accelerate completion of a project or 
classes of projects or programs by reducing delays in historic 
preservation review and consultation.
    ``(3) Such requests under paragraph (1) shall be approved only for 
the additional amounts that the Secretary determines are necessary for 
a State historic preservation office, tribal historic preservation 
office, or the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation to expedite 
the review and consultation process and only where the Secretary 
determines that such additional amounts will permit completion of the 
historic preservation process in less than the time customarily 
required for such process.''.

        including facilities on the Interstate System, to manage 
        existing high levels of congestion or reduce emissions in a 
        nonattainment area or maintenance area.
            (2) Basic program.--The following conditions apply to any 
        variable toll pricing program established under this section:
                    (A) Limitation on use of revenues.--All toll 
                revenues received from the operation of the toll 
                facility shall be used first for debt service, 
                reasonable return on investment of any private 
                financing, and the costs necessary for proper operation 
                and maintenance of the toll facility (including 
                reconstruction, resurfacing, restoration, and 
                rehabilitation). If the State or public authority 
                certifies annually that the tolled facility is being 
                adequately maintained, then the State or public 
                authority may use any excess toll revenues for projects 
                eligible for Federal assistance under title 23, United 
                States Code.
                    (B) Agreement.--Before the Secretary may permit 
                tolling under this subsection, and for each facility 
                that may be tolled, the Secretary and the State or 
                public authority must enter into an agreement providing 
                for the conditions in subparagraphs (A) and (C) of this 
                paragraph. The agreement shall terminate upon the 
                decision of the State or public authority to 
                discontinue its variable tolling program for that 
                facility. If there is any debt outstanding on the 
                facility at the time the decision is made to 
                discontinue the program, the facility may continue to 
                be tolled in accordance with the terms of the agreement 
                until the debt is retired.
                    (C) Requirements.--
                            (i) Variable price requirement.--The 
                        Secretary shall require, for each facility that 
                        may be tolled under this subsection, that the 
                        tolls vary in price according to time of day, 
                        as appropriate, to manage congestion or to

                        established under section 102(a)(2) of title 
                        23, United States Code, a State may permit 
                        vehicles with fewer than 2 occupants to operate 
                        in high occupancy vehicle lanes as part of a 
                        variable toll pricing program established under 
                        this subsection.
                    (D) Limitation on federal share.--The Federal share 
                payable for projects on the tolled facility, including 
                projects to install toll collection facilities, shall 
                be a percentage determined by the State but shall not 
                exceed 80 percent.
            (3) Eligibility.--To be eligible to participate in the 
        program, a State or public authority shall provide to the

SEC. 1702. REAL-TIME SYSTEM MANAGEMENT INFORMATION PROGRAM.

    (a) Goals and Purposes.--
            (1) Goals.--The goals of the real-time system management 
        information program are to provide the nationwide capability to 
        monitor, in real-time, the traffic and travel conditions of our 
        nation's major highways and to widely share that information to 
        improve the security of the surface transportation system, 
        address congestion problems, support improved response to 
        weather events, and facilitate national and regional traveler 
        information.
            (2) Purposes.--The purposes of the real-time system 
        management information program are to--
                    (A) establish a nationwide system of basic real-
                time information for managing and operating our surface 
                transportation system;
                    (B) identify longer range real-time highway and 
                transit monitoring needs and develop plans and 
                strategies for meeting those needs; and
                    (C) provide the capability and means to share that 
                data with state and local governments, and the 
                traveling public.
    (b) Data Exchange Formats.--Within one year of enactment of this 
Act, the Secretary shall establish data exchange formats to ensure that 
the data provided by highway and transit monitoring systems, including 
statewide incident reporting systems can readily be exchanged across 
jurisdictional boundaries, facilitating nationwide availability of 
information.
    (c) Statewide Incident Reporting System.--Within 2 years of 
enactment of this legislation, each State shall establish a statewide 
incident reporting system.
    (d) Regional Intelligent Transportation System Architecture.--
            (1) As State and local governments develop or update their 
        regional ITS architectures, as specified in section 940.9 of 
        title 23, Code of Federal Regulations (Regional ITS 
        Architecture), they shall explicitly address their real-time 
        highway and transit information needs and the systems needed to 
        meet those needs. This specific incorporation of information 
        needs should address coverage, monitoring systems, data fusion 
        and archiving, and methods of exchanging or sharing this 
        information.
            (2) States are encouraged to incorporate the data exchange 
        formats developed by the Secretary to ensure that the data 
        provided by highway and transit monitoring systems can readily 
        be exchanged across state and local governments, and with the 
        traveling public.

        its programs on a performance basis, the State's commitment to 
conduct the required evaluations, and the degree to which the 
application otherwise proposes to achieve the purposes of this section.
    (c) Program Elements.--
            (1) State agreement to assume secretary's 
        responsibilities.--
                    (A) Assignment and assumption of 
                responsibilities.--The Secretary and a State may agree, 
                as provided in this section, that the Secretary will 
                assign and the State will assume some or all of the 
                responsibilities of the Secretary under any Federal law 
                or requirement, except for the responsibilities 
                relating to Federally recognized tribes, with respect 
                to any project constructed with federal funds under 
                this pilot program. The State shall assume these 
                responsibilities subject to the same procedural and 
                substantive requirements as would be required if such 
                responsibilities were carried out by the Secretary. 
                When a State assumes such responsibilities under a 
                Federal law, the State shall be solely responsible and 
                solely liable for complying with and carrying out that 
                law in lieu of the Secretary and shall submit a 
                certification as provided in subsection (f)(1).
                    (B) Federal role of state.--For purposes of 
                assuming the Secretary's responsibilities under a 
                Surface Transportation System Performance Pilot 
                Program, to the extent the State is carrying out the 
                Secretary's responsibilities under the National 
                Environmental Policy Act, title 23, United States Code, 
                or any other Federal law, the State shall be deemed to 
                be a Federal agency under such laws, and shall agree 
                that its transportation department, or any other State 
                agency carrying out a responsibility of the Secretary 
                under this section, shall be subject to such Federal 
                laws to the same extent that a Federal agency would be 
                subject to such laws.
                    (C) State certification of assumption of 
                responsibilities.--Whenever a State assumes any of the 
                Secretary's responsibilities under a Federal law, the 
                State shall certify that it has laws and regulations 
                that--
                            (i) authorize the State to take the actions 
                        necessary to carry out the responsibilities 
                        being assumed; and
                            (ii) are comparable to the Federal Freedom 
                        of Information Act and that any decision 
                        regarding the public availability of a document 
                        under those laws is reviewable by a court of 
                        competent authority.
            (2) Other federal agency views.--If a State assumes a 
        responsibility of the Secretary under paragraph (1) of this 
        subsection that would have required the Secretary to consult 
        with another Federal agency, the Secretary shall solicit the 
        views of such Federal agency prior to entering into or renewing 
        any program agreement.
            (3) Maintenance of effort.--The Secretary shall not make 
        any apportionment to a State participating in this performance 
        pilot program in any fiscal year under sections 104(b)(1), 
        104(b)(3), 104(b)(4), 104(b)(5), 105, and 144(e) of title 23, 
        United States Code, unless the State enters into such 
        agreements with the Secretary as the Secretary may require to 
        ensure that the State will maintain its non-Federal 
        transportation capital expenditures in any fiscal year at or 
        above the average level of such expenditures for the preceding 
        three fiscal years.
            (4) Federal share payable.--The Federal share payable under 
        this performance pilot program for a project funded with 
        apportionments under sections 104(b)(1), 104(b)(3), 104(b)(4), 
        104(b)(5), 105, and 144(e) of title 23, United States Code, may 
        be up to 100 percent; except that, the Federal share payable 
        for transportation enhancements under section 133(d)(1), shall 
        be determined in accordance with title 23, United States Code.
    (d) Program Agreement.--
            (1) In general.--Each year prior to making any 
        apportionments to a participating State, the Secretary shall 
        enter into an agreement with the State establishing its 
        performance goals and performance measures.
            (2) Agreement concerning participating state's 
        responsibilities.--The Secretary shall enter into one or more 
        agreements with a State selected for participation in this 
        pilot program concerning which, if any, Federal laws or 
        requirements the State will carry out under subsection (c). The 
        program agreement between the Secretary and the State shall 
        specify management responsibilities, including the role of the 
        State in relation to other Federal agencies.
            (3) Goals.--The Secretary and participating State shall 
        agree, based on the State's priorities and the areas of 
        national strategic importance as determined by the Secretary, 
        on the long-term and short-term goals to be achieved using the 
        State's apportionments under the program.
            (4) Performance measures.--The Secretary and the State 
        shall mutually establish the performance measures that the 
        State must meet relating to the goals identified in paragraph 
        (3) of this subsection. Continued participation in the pilot 
        program is contingent on the State meeting these performance 
        measures. If a State fails to meet the agreed upon performance 
        measures in two consecutive years, the Secretary shall 
        terminate a State's participation in the pilot program.
            (5) Compliance.--If a participating State fails to comply 
        with any provision of this section, the Secretary shall take 
        such actions as necessary to ensure compliance. Corrective 
        actions may include termination of the State's participation in 
        the pilot program.
    (e) Limitations on Agreements.--
            (1) Civil rights.--Nothing in this section shall be 
        construed as relieving the Secretary from any of the 
        Secretary's responsibilities under title VI of the Civil Rights 
        Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000d, et seq.).
            (2) Major projects.--Nothing in this section shall be 
        construed as relieving the Secretary from any of the 
        Secretary's responsibilities with respect to major projects 
        under section 106(h) of title 23, United States Code.
            (3) Statewide and metropolitan planning.--Nothing in this 
        section shall be construed as relieving the Secretary from any 
        of the Secretary's responsibilities under the Statewide and 
metropolitan planning requirements of sections 134 and 135 of title 23, 
United States Code.
            (4) Regulatory responsibilities.--Nothing in this section 
        shall be construed to allow a State to assume any of the 
        Secretary's rulemaking authority under any Federal law.
    (f) State Reporting and Accountability.--A State participating in 
this pilot program shall make the following reports to the Secretary. A 
State may combine reports as appropriate.
            (1) State certification prior to obligation of funds.--As a 
        prerequisite to the Secretary's agreement that a State will 
        fulfill or assume any of the Secretary's responsibilities, and 
        prior to the obligation of any money under this pilot program 
        in any fiscal year, the participating State shall provide, and 
        annually renew, a certification that--
                    (A) is in a form acceptable to the Secretary;
                    (B) is executed by the Governor or the State's top-
                ranking transportation official charged with the 
                responsibility for highway construction;
                    (C) specifies that the State will fully carry out 
                any of the responsibilities it may assume;
                    (D) specifies that the State consents to assume the 
                status of the Secretary under any responsibility it may 
                assume; and
                    (E) expressly consents on behalf of the State and 
                himself or herself to accept the jurisdiction of the 
                Federal courts for the compliance, discharge, and 
                enforcement of any responsibility of the Secretary it 
                may assume.
            (2) End of fiscal year state certification.--At the end of 
        each fiscal year in which a State obligates funds under this 
        pilot program, the State shall certify that it obligated such 
        funds only for projects that would otherwise be eligible for 
        assistance under title 23. Such certification shall also 
        specify that the State reserved for obligation the amounts 
        specified in section 133(d)(1) of such title as amended by this 
        Act.
            (3) Fiscal accountability.--Each State shall provide an 
        annual accounting for the obligations in a manner determined by 
        the Secretary in such a way as to provide a basis for 
        evaluating the effect of the pilot program expenditures.
            (4) Annual state assessment.--Each State will provide to 
        the Secretary a narrative report at the end of each year 
        describing the benefits of the pilot program to the State and 
        any suggestions for improving the pilot program.
    (g) Termination.--This pilot program shall terminate six years 
following enactment of this Act. Funding obligated under the pilot 
program shall continue to be administered under the terms of the pilot 
program until those funds have been expended.

        Such suggestions may include combining or eliminating otherwise 
        inefficient use of expensive parts of the original proposal

understanding.

State in accordance with section 206(c)(1) of this title.

                the owner in comparison to other affected property 
                owners and requests the acquisition to alleviate that 
                hardship.
