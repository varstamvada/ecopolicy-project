                         CONCURRENT RESOLUTION


 
Condemning fear-mongering, racism, anti-Semitism, bigotry, and violence 
                      perpetrated by hate groups.

Whereas on the night of Friday, August 11, 2017, a day before a planned White 
        supremacist march was to occur in Charlottesville, Virginia, hundreds of 
        torch-bearing White extremist protesters chanting racist and anti-
        Semitic slogans gathered on the grounds of the University of Virginia in 
        Charlottesville, Virginia;
Whereas on Saturday, August 12, 2017, ahead of the scheduled start time of such 
        White supremacist march, protesters and counterdemonstrators gathered at 
        Emancipation Park in Charlottesville, Virginia;
Whereas the White supremacist march turned violent, culminating in the death of 
        peaceful, counterdemonstrators Heather Heyer and injuries sustained by 
        19 others after a car driven by a neo-Nazi sympathizer deliberately 
        struck the counterdemonstrators;
Whereas two Virginia State Troopers, Lt. H. Jay Cullen and Trooper-Pilot Berke 
        M.M. Bates, perished in a helicopter crash as they were responding to 
        the march;
Whereas in response to the events, President Trump said, ``We condemn in the 
        strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry, and 
        violence on many sides, on many sides. It's been going on for a long 
        time in our country. Not Donald Trump, not Barack Obama. This has been 
        going on for a long, long time.'';
Whereas Members of Congress from both the Republican and the Democratic parties 
        called on the President to make clear that this statement was grossly 
        inadequate as it failed to denounce domestic terrorism perpetrated by 
        the White supremacist, neo-Nazi, and Ku Klux Klan groups in 
        Charlottesville;
Whereas White supremacist hate websites praised the President's incomplete 
        statements, with a member of one such White supremacist group saying, 
        ``Trump comments were good. He didn't attack us . . . Nothing specific 
        against us . . . Also refused to answer a question about White 
        nationalists supporting him. No condemnation at all. When asked to 
        condemn, he just walked out of the room. Really, really good . . .'';
Whereas when President Trump made a statement more than two days after the 
        violence that occurred in Charlottesville, he still failed to place 
        blame for that violence directly on the White supremacist groups; and
Whereas White supremacist and hate groups are now organizing similar rallies in 
        cities across the United States and communities everywhere are suffering 
        from fear at the growing and open display of hate and violence being 
        perpetrated by such groups: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), 
That Congress--
            (1) condemns the role of White supremacist groups in 
        inciting violence in Charlottesville, Virginia;
            (2) denounces the increase in organizing and the increase 
        in fear-mongering, racism, anti-Semitism, bigotry, and violence 
        perpetrated by White supremacist, neo-Nazi, Ku Klux Klan, and 
        other hate groups;
            (3) offers its deepest condolences and sympathies to the 
        family of Heather Heyer, Lt. H. Jay Cullen, and Trooper-Pilot 
        Berke M.M. Bates and wishes a quick recovery to those injured; 
        and
            (4) strongly urges President Trump--
                    (A) to disavow any support received from White 
                supremacist, neo-Nazi, Ku Klux Klan, and other hate 
                groups;
                    (B) terminate from employment with (or any 
                contractual relationship with), and prohibit the hiring 
                of, individuals in the White House or the Trump 
                Administration who have supported or encouraged support 
                for White supremacists;
                    (C) to use all available resources of the office of 
                the President and the Cabinet to address the growing 
                prevalence of such hate groups domestically; and
                    (D) to use the office of the President to unite the 
                country against hate.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
