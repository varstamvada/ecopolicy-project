                of paragraphs (6)(C), (9)(A), and (9)(C) of section 
                212(a) if the alien establishes to the satisfaction of 
                the Secretary that the alien does not pose a threat to 
                the public and has not committed any criminal offenses 
                in violation of Federal or State law unrelated to the

                the Armed Forces, was discharged or released under

        under section 204(a)(1)(A) as an immediate relative (as defined 
        in section 201(b)) by reason of the marriage to such 
        citizen.''.

SEC. 3. TREATMENT OF CERTAIN GROUNDS FOR INADMISSIBILITY FOR CERTAIN 
              MILITARY SPOUSES.

    Section 212 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1182) 
is amended by inserting after subsection (b) the following:
    ``(c)(1) In determining the admissibility as an immigrant of an 
alien described in paragraph (2)--
            ``(A) subsection (a)(9)(B) shall not apply; and

        of the Secretary, may waive the application of paragraphs 
        (6)(C), (9)(A), and (9)(C) of subsection (a) if the alien 
        establishes to the satisfaction of the Secretary that the alien 
        does not pose a threat to the public and has not committed any 
        criminal offenses in violation of Federal or State law 
        unrelated to the alien's status.

            ``(A) is or was the spouse of a United States citizen who--
                    ``(i) is or was serving on active duty in the 
                United States Armed Forces or in a reserve component of 
                the United States Armed Forces; and
                    ``(ii) if discharged or released from service in 
                the Armed Forces, was discharged or released under 
                honorable conditions; and

        under section 204(a)(1)(A) as an immediate relative (as defined 
        in section 201(b)) by reason of the marriage to such 
        citizen.''.

SEC. 4. ELIGIBILITY OF REMOVED OR VOLUNTARILY DEPARTED ALIENS.

    (a) In General.--The Secretary of Homeland Security and the 
Secretary of State shall take such steps as may be necessary to ensure 
that eligible aliens who were removed or permitted to depart 
voluntarily from the United States before the date of the enactment of 
this Act may apply from abroad for an immigrant visa pursuant to the 
amendment made by section 3.
    (b) Nonimmigrant Admission Pending Adjudication.--The Secretary of 
Homeland Security and the Secretary of State shall establish a program 
under which an eligible alien with a pending application made under 
subsection (a) may be authorized to enter the United States as a 
nonimmigrant to reunite with their United States citizen spouse during 
the period in which such application, and an associated application for 
adjustment of status, remain pending. In determining whether an alien 
is eligible to be admitted to the United States as a nonimmigrant under 
this subsection, the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Secretary 
of State shall require the alien to establish to the satisfaction of 
each Secretary that the alien does not pose a threat to the public or 
to national security. In determining the admissibility as a 
nonimmigrant of an alien described in this subsection, the Secretary of 
Homeland Security, in the discretion of the Secretary, may waive the 
application of paragraphs (6)(C) and (9) of section 212(a) of the 
Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1182(a)).
