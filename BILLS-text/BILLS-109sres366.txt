                               RESOLUTION


 
   Affirming the importance of increased international action and a 
national week of prayer for the Ugandan victims of Joseph Kony's Lord's 
  Resistance Army, and expressing the sense of the Senate that Sudan, 
Uganda, and the international community bring justice and humanitarian 
  assistance to Northern Uganda and that February 2 through 9, 2006, 
 should be designated as a national week of prayer and reflection for 
                         the people of Uganda.

Whereas Joseph Kony has led the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) since 1987, 
        terrorizing the region of Northern Uganda;
Whereas up to 200,000 people have been killed in violent conflict and from 
        disease and malnutrition;
Whereas 80 to 90 percent of Kony's fighters are enslaved children--brutalized 
        and brainwashed to kill;
Whereas sources estimate that between 20,000 and 50,000 children have been 
        abducted by the LRA since 1987;
Whereas these children are sexually abused, raped, beaten, taunted and 
        traumatized by older soldiers in the LRA;
Whereas these children are maliciously coerced to mutilate, rape, and murder 
        others, even their own family members and friends;
Whereas LRA leaders often force the friends and siblings of unsuccessful 
        escapees to carry out vicious punishments to further the LRA's culture 
        of fear, intimidation and guilt;
Whereas even those children who do manage to escape are unspeakably traumatized, 
        often infected with sexually transmitted diseases, and stigmatized by 
        society;
Whereas approximately 40,000 children in rural Uganda trek miles into towns each 
        night to sleep under the protection of soldiers and attempt to avoid 
        capture;
Whereas more than 1.6 million people have been forced to flee their homes;
Whereas the conflict has slowed Uganda's development efforts, costing the 
        country at least $1.33 billion, or 3 percent of its GDP; and
Whereas, starting in October 2005, the Sudan government gave Joseph Kony a three 
        month grace period to surrender: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate--
            (1) that the government of Sudan continue to prosecute LRA 
        terrorists within its borders and aid Uganda in ending the 
        conflict;
            (2) that Uganda use every available resource to end the 
        atrocities of the LRA and bring its members to justice;
            (3) that the United States and international community 
        recognize the atrocities occurring daily in Uganda and provide 
        necessary humanitarian assistance; and
            (4) that the week of February 2 through 9, 2006, should be 
        designated as a National Week of Prayer and Reflection for the 
        people of Northern Uganda.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
