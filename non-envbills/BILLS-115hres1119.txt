                               RESOLUTION


 
Urging the people of the United States to observe October of each year 
            as Italian and Italian-American Heritage Month.

Whereas Italian and Italian-American Heritage Month is an appropriate time to 
        recognize the enormous contributions the Italian and Italian-American 
        people have made to this country and the world throughout our history, 
        including generals, admirals, philosophers, statesmen, musicians, 
        athletes, and Nobel Prize-winning scientists;
Whereas Italian and Italian-American Heritage Month is held to salute the 
        Italian and Italian-American community and to exhibit appreciation for 
        their culture and their heritage that have immeasurably enriched the 
        lives of the people of this Nation and the world;
Whereas the strength and success of the United States, the vitality of our 
        communities, and the effectiveness of our American society depend, in 
        great measure, upon the distinctive and sterling qualities demonstrated 
        by our various ethnic groups, exemplified by members of the Italian and 
        Italian-American community, who share with us their rich and unique 
        heritage; and
Whereas it is fitting and proper that October of each year be observed as 
        Italian and Italian-American Heritage Month throughout the United 
        States: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That in order to recognize the enormous contributions 
Italian and Italian-American people have made to this country and the 
world throughout our history, the House of Representatives urges the 
people of the United States to acknowledge an Italian and Italian-
American Heritage Month and to observe the month with appropriate 
events and activities.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
