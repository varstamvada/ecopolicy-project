                               RESOLUTION


 
Condemning the President's threat to shut down the United States-Mexico 
         border to the detriment of the United States economy.

Whereas President Trump is threatening to shut down the United States-Mexico 
        border if Mexico does not stop the flow of Central American children and 
        families to the United States;
Whereas the sudden closure of the United States-Mexico border would have grave 
        consequences for the American economy, American jobs, and daily lives of 
        American families, both in border communities and across every State in 
        the Union;
Whereas the unexpected supply chain disruption caused by suddenly closing the 
        United States-Mexico border could result in work stoppages at American 
        auto and manufacturing plants, risking the furlough of American workers 
        and the shutdown of production lines;
Whereas the disruption caused by suddenly closing the United States-Mexico 
        border could result in severe shortages of many fruits, vegetables, and 
        other fresh food, leading to collapsing food supplies, soaring food 
        prices, and bare shelves in groceries nationwide;
Whereas suddenly closing the United States-Mexico border could have further 
        consequences on the American farm economy, hurting family farms, 
        growers, pork producers, dairy producers, and more, leading to rotting 
        produce and other disruptions felt later in the season;
Whereas spending by Mexican tourists in the United States totaled $20.3 billion 
        in 2016 alone;
Whereas the President's counterproductive policies have consistently worsened 
        the situation at the United States-Mexico border;
Whereas, since fiscal year 2016, Congress has invested more than $2.6 billion to 
        support implementation of the United States Strategy for Engagement in 
        Central America aimed at strengthening communities in the region and 
        preventing children and families from making the dangerous trek from El 
        Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras to the United States-Mexico border;
Whereas suspending United States assistance to Central America will worsen 
        conditions in Central America and promote increased migration to the 
        United States;
Whereas according to former United States Southern Command (SOUTHCOM) Commander 
        Admiral James Stavridis, ``The best thing we could do to reduce the flow 
        of refugees from Central America is to help them improve conditions 
        there. Suddenly stopping all foreign aid there will only increase the 
        driving forces creating the caravans over time, which will be even more 
        costly to deal with on our border. It is like stopping your preventative 
        medications, then wondering why you need surgery a year later.'';
Whereas only one day after the Secretary of Homeland Security entered into a 
        promising multilateral compact with Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador 
        to address migration flows, the President announced plans to terminate 
        United States foreign assistance to those countries;
Whereas the President blocking the use of funds appropriated by Congress for 
        bipartisan initiatives that address the root causes of child and family 
        migration from Central America will exacerbate the situation at the 
        border;
Whereas instead of working to reduce humanitarian suffering at the United 
        States-Mexico border, the President has intentionally worsened 
        conditions for asylum-seeking individuals who have a right to due 
        process and humane treatment when arriving at the border;
Whereas Congress appropriated $192,700,000 above the President's budget request 
        for fiscal year 2019 for U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) for 
        humanitarian relief at the southern border, including $128,000,000 for 
        contract medical professionals, $40,200,000 for food, infant formula and 
        diapers, and $24,500,000 for transportation between CBP facilities;
Whereas Congress appropriated funding for 484 immigration judge teams in fiscal 
        year 2018, of which only 395 were on-board as of September 30, 2018, and 
        provided funding for 534 immigration judge teams in fiscal year 2019; 
        and
Whereas the President's conduct in the name of border security has consistently 
        worsened the humanitarian needs at the United States-Mexico border and 
        threatened further chaos in the jobs, economy, and daily lives of 
        American families across the country: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) opposes the President's reckless threatened closure of 
        the United States-Mexico border, which would severely 
        jeopardize the Nation's economic, national, and homeland 
        security interests;
            (2) opposes the President's action blocking the funds 
        appropriated by Congress to address the root causes of 
        migration at their source, thereby needlessly fueling the 
        situation at the United States-Mexico border; and
            (3) affirms asylum-seeking individuals have a right to due 
        process and humane treatment when arriving at the United 
        States-Mexico border, consistent with our most treasured 
        American values as a Nation that has been a beacon and a refuge 
        to the world.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
