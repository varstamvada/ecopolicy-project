  Designating the month of June 2018 as ``Immigrant Heritage Month''.

Whereas the United States has a rich history because the United States has 
        always been a country of immigrants;
Whereas the diverse heritage of the United States is one of the defining aspects 
        of the country's success story;
Whereas generations of immigrants from every corner of the globe have helped 
        build the economy of the United States and created the unique character 
        of the country;
Whereas the United States has long served as a melting pot of cultural 
        diversity;
Whereas immigrants continue to grow businesses, innovate, strengthen the 
        economy, and create jobs for people in the United States; and
Whereas many immigrants are entrepreneurs and business owners: Now, therefore, 
        be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates June 2018 as ``Immigrant Heritage Month'';
            (2) recognizes the significance of Immigrant Heritage Month 
        as an important time to celebrate the contributions of 
        immigrants to the history of the United States; and
            (3) urges the people of the United States to observe 
        Immigrant Heritage Month with appropriate programs and 
        activities.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
