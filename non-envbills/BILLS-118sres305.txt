                   IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES

_______________________________________________________________________

                               RESOLUTION


 
 Commemorating the 50th anniversary of hip hop and designating August 
 11, 2023, as ``Hip Hop Celebration Day'', designating August 2023 as 
 ``Hip Hop Recognition Month'', and designating November 2023 as ``Hip 
                          Hop History Month''.

Whereas 2023 is the 50th anniversary of the creation of hip hop;
Whereas, on August 11, 1973, Clive ``DJ Kool Herc'' Campbell introduced his 
        innovative style of disc jockeying at an event organized by his sister, 
        Cindy Campbell, called the ``Back To School Jam'', which was held in the 
        recreation room of 1520 Sedgwick Avenue in the Bronx, New York;
Whereas, together, Clive ``DJ Kool Herc'' Campbell and the master of ceremonies 
        engaged the crowd with rap on the microphone, while partygoers known as 
        B-boys and B-girls danced, and introduced a new style, later known as 
        ``hip hop'', which combined the elements of a disc jockey (commonly 
        known as a ``DJ''), a master of ceremonies (commonly known as an 
        ``MC''), music, art, and dance;
Whereas Clive ``DJ Kool Herc'' Campbell was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall 
        of Fame in 2023;
Whereas, from the humble beginnings of hip hop in New York City, the music, 
        lyricism, dance, and art of hip hop has become a culture found in 
        communities across the United States, and has long been a worldwide 
        phenomenon;
Whereas the art and culture of hip hop is an original creation of the United 
        States and one of the most popular genres of music within the United 
        States;
Whereas hip hop has had notable Southern influences following its Northern 
        inception, such as jazz and bounce from New Orleans, Louisiana, the 
        blues from Mississippi, and country from the South, and these influences 
        along with other celebrated genres of music, such as disco, gospel, 
        soul, rock and roll, and Indigenous music from across the United States, 
        have all helped hip hop transcend boundaries and contributed significant 
        intellectual heritage and regional influence to the creation and 
        progression of hip hop over the last century;
Whereas the hip hop genre has been reinvented often over the years since 1973, 
        reflecting the State, city, and region of the music, from G-funk and 
        hyphy on the West Coast, to bass and trap in the South, to drill in the 
        Midwest, to many other sounds from coast to coast and from abroad, 
        including contemporary hip hop, which continues that trend by allowing 
        listeners not only to unwind and escape through a rhythmic beat but also 
        to resonate and empathize with the stories being told;
Whereas hip hop artists and supporters, originally of African heritage, now 
        transcend many different ages, ethnicities, religions, locations, 
        political affiliations, and socioeconomic statuses, which demonstrates 
        the versatility and inclusivity of hip hop art and culture;
Whereas the art and culture of hip hop have been adapted in many innovative 
        forms that are inspirational, challenging, humorous, thought-provoking, 
        and spiritual;
Whereas hip hop as a multidimensional art form and lifestyle continues to 
        produce new subgenres of music and stylistic lexicons and promotes new 
        cultural imprints, trends, and movements that reverberate across the 
        United States and around the globe;
Whereas hip hop has provided opportunities for extracurricular activities, youth 
        empowerment, creative outlets, physical fitness, vocabulary exercises, 
        poetry, analytical thinking, entertainment, employment, and economic 
        impact and has become an industry that generates more than 
        $1,000,000,000 annually;
Whereas hip hop art, education, and culture have positive effects on society;
Whereas, on August 11, 2023, the Federal Government, States, cities, and towns 
        will observe Hip Hop Celebration Day;
Whereas, during the month of August 2023, the Federal Government, States, 
        cities, and towns will observe Hip Hop Recognition Month; and
Whereas, during the month of November 2023, the Federal Government, States, 
        cities, and towns will observe Hip Hop History Month: Now, therefore, be 
        it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates August 11, 2023, as ``Hip Hop Celebration 
        Day'';
            (2) designates the month of August 2023 as ``Hip Hop 
        Recognition Month'';
            (3) designates the month of November 2023 as ``Hip Hop 
        History Month'';
            (4) recognizes the 50 years of contributions of hip hop to 
        art and culture;
            (5) encourages Senators to commemorate the 50th anniversary 
        of hip hop and support appropriate activities that recognize 
        the historic milestone and cultural legacy of the ``Back to 
        School Jam'' of August 11, 1973; and
            (6) encourages local governments in the United States to 
        build partnerships with local hip hop entities and other 
        members of the creative arts and music communities in 
        celebration of the 50th anniversary of hip hop.
