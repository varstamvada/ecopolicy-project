    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the

SECTION 1. ALIEN REPATRIATION.

    Section 243(d) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 
1253(d)) is amended to read as follows:
    ``(d) Ensuring Return of Removed Aliens.--
            ``(1) Discontinuing granting visas to nationals of 
        countries denying or delaying accepting alien.--On being 
        notified by the Secretary of Homeland Security that the 
        government of a foreign country denies or unreasonably delays 
        accepting an alien who is a citizen, subject, national, or 
        resident of that country after the Secretary of Homeland 
        Security asks whether the government will accept the alien 
        under this section, the Secretary of State shall order consular 
        officers in that foreign country to discontinue granting 
        immigrant visas or nonimmigrant visas, or both, to citizens, 
        subjects, nationals, and residents of that country until the 
        Secretary of Homeland Security notifies the Secretary of State 
        that the country has accepted the alien.
            ``(2) Denying admission to foreign government officials of 
        countries denying alien return.--If the Secretary of Homeland 
        Security determines that the government of a foreign country 
        denies or unreasonably delays accepting an alien who is a 
        citizen, subject, national, or resident of that country after 
        the alien has been ordered removed, the Secretary of Homeland 
        Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State, may deny 
        admission to any citizen, subject, national, or resident of 
        that country who is seeking or has received a nonimmigrant visa 
        pursuant to subparagraphs (A) and (G) of section 101(a)(15).
            ``(3) Quarterly reports.--Not later than 90 days after the 
        date of the enactment of the Foreign Relations Authorization 
        Act, Fiscal Years 2010 and 2011, and every 3 months thereafter, 
        the Secretary of Homeland Security shall submit to the Congress 
        a report that--
                    ``(A) lists all the countries which refuse or 
                unreasonably delay repatriation; and
                    ``(B) includes the total number of aliens who were 
                refused repatriation, disaggregated by--
                            ``(i) country;
                            ``(ii) detention status; and
                            ``(iii) criminal status.''.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
