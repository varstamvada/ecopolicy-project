Whereas the Museum of Pop Culture in Seattle, Washington, is the flagship museum 
        in the United States dedicated to the preservation and scholarship of 
        pop culture and pop culture history;
Whereas the Museum of Pop Culture acknowledges the universal language of pop 
        culture and its ability to challenge society to uplift voices, inspire 
        generations, and challenge societal paradigms;
Whereas the Museum of Pop Culture explores the dynamic force of pop culture and 
        how it shapes our perspective and conversations by delving into iconic 
        moments, trends, creators, and creations that leave a lasting mark on 
        our collective consciousness and the profound impact of pop culture on 
        our lives;
Whereas the Museum of Pop Culture's meticulous and dedicated efforts transcend 
        traditional notions of museum-worthiness, actively preserving the 
        history of pop culture and honoring narratives that challenge 
        established stories;
Whereas the Museum of Pop Culture, through scholarship and shared expertise, 
        catalyzes a new understanding of the significance of pop culture, 
        contributing to a broader and more inclusive perspective;
Whereas the Museum of Pop Culture pays tribute to how pop culture has shaped 
        many different forms of creative expression, from fashion, music, visual 
        art, television, film, and more;
Whereas the Museum of Pop Culture proudly celebrates and preserves one of the 
        world's largest collections of pop culture artifacts and oral histories, 
        including several of the largest collections of artifacts related to 
        hip-hop, science fiction, Jimi Hendrix, and the original ``Star Trek'', 
        recognizing pop culture as a cultural art form with global significance;
Whereas the Museum of Pop Culture serves as a unique and valuable resource 
        locally and nationwide in expanding knowledge of the importance of pop 
        culture and pop culture history and its impact globally; and
Whereas it is appropriate to designate the Museum of Pop Culture in Seattle, 
        Washington, as the ``National Museum of Pop Culture'': Now, therefore, 
        be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives recognizes the Museum 
of Pop Culture in Seattle, Washington, as the ``National Museum of Pop 
Culture''.
