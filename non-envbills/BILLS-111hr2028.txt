the Social Security Administration as to whether there is expected, 
over the 75-year period following the date of the entry into force of 
the agreement, a net reduction in any positive actuarial balance for 
such period of the social security system established by this title (or 
a net increase in any negative actuarial balance for such period for 
such system) attributable to the operation of such agreement equal to

        period, to the present value of the taxable payroll for such 
        period.
            ``(iv) The term `adjusted summarized cost rate' means, over 
        a period, the ratio (expressed as a percentage) of the sum of

        including scheduled benefit payments, special monthly payments 
        to certain uninsured persons who have 3 or more quarters of

described in subparagraph (A) of paragraph (3) in connection with an 
agreement entered into under this section is that, with respect to the 
75-year period described in such subparagraph, there is expected a net 
reduction, in the actuarial balance for such period of the social 
security system established by this title, which--
            ``(A) is attributable to the operation of such agreement, 
        and

(2)(A), it shall be in order as a matter of highest privilege in each 
House of the Congress to consider a bill or joint resolution described
