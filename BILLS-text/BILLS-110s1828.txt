           United States of certain ethanol-blended gasoline.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. STUDY OF INCREASED CONSUMPTION OF ETHANOL-BLENDED GASOLINE 
              WITH HIGHER LEVELS OF ETHANOL.

    (a) In General.--The Administrator of the Environmental Protection 
Agency, in cooperation with the Secretary of Energy, the Secretary of 
Agriculture, and the Secretary of Transportation, and after providing 
notice and an opportunity for public comment, shall conduct a study of 
the feasibility of increasing consumption in the United States of 
ethanol-blended gasoline with levels of ethanol of not less than 10 
percent and not more than 40 percent.
    (b) Study.--The study under subsection (a) shall include--
            (1) a review of production and infrastructure constraints 
        on increasing the consumption of ethanol;
            (2) an evaluation of the economic, market, and energy 
        impacts of State and regional differences in ethanol blends;
            (3) an evaluation of the economic, market, and energy 
        impacts on gasoline retailers and consumers of separate and 
        distinctly-labeled fuel storage facilities and dispensers;
            (4) an evaluation on the environmental impacts of mid-level 
        ethanol blends on evaporative and exhaust emissions from on-
        road, off-road and marine engines, recreational boats, 
        vehicles, and equipment;
            (5) an evaluation of the impacts of mid-level ethanol 
        blends on the operation, durability and performance of onroad, 
        off-road, and marine engines, recreational boats, vehicles, and 
        equipment; and
            (6) an evaluation of the safety impacts of mid-level 
        ethanol blends on consumers that own and operate off-road and 
        marine engines, recreational boats, vehicles, or equipment.
    (c) Report.--Not later than 18 months after the date of enactment 
of this Act, the Administrator shall submit to Congress a report 
describing the results of the study conducted under this section.
    (d) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized to be 
appropriated to the Administrator to carry out the study under this 
section $1,000,000.
    (e) Technical Amendment.--Section 211(f)(4) of the Clean Air Act 
(42 U.S.C. 7545(f)(4)) is amended by striking the last sentence and 
inserting the following: ``The Administrator may approve an application 
to waive a prohibition under paragraph (1) or (3), or the limitation 
specified in paragraph (2), only after providing for notice and an 
opportunity for public comment.''.
