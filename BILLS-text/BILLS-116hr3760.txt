SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) There are an estimated 2,500,000 domestic workers 
        across the United States working in the homes of people of the 
        United States to provide home and personal care, child care, 
        and house cleaning services.
            (2) Domestic work makes all other work possible. It is work 
        that cannot be outsourced to workers living outside of the 
        United States, nor is it close to being automated. Without the 
        millions of domestic workers caring for children, seniors, and 
        individuals with disabilities, and cleaning homes, much of the 
        economy would come to a standstill.
            (3) The employment of individuals in domestic service in 
        households affects commerce as described in section 2(a) of the 
        Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 202(a)).
            (4) Domestic workers are hired or contacted for work by 
        phone, mail, or Internet, or through newspaper ads, and travel 
        to work through transportation on interstate highways, 
        interstate transit, or vehicles in interstate commerce.
            (5) In 2016, the Bureau of Labor Statistics predicted that 
        between 2016 and 2026--
                    (A) the number of new jobs for home health and 
                personal care aides will increase 41 percent, which is 
                an increase of 1,200,000 jobs and the largest increase 
                in new jobs of any occupational category during such 
                period; and
                    (B) the number of new jobs for child care and house 
                cleaning positions will increase 6 to 7 percent.
            (6) Nine out of ten domestic workers are women, and such 
        women are disproportionately people of color and immigrants. 
        Women, people of color, and immigrants have historically faced 
        barriers to employment and economic advancement.
            (7) Domestic workers face low wages and unacceptable 
        working conditions. Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics 
        indicates that the average wage for a domestic worker is 
        approximately $11 per hour, or $23,000 per year if working 
        full-time. In practice, the average wage for a domestic worker 
        is less than such approximation given that domestic work has 
        largely been negotiated in the informal labor market.
            (8) A landmark study of domestic workers published in 2012 
        by the National Domestic Workers Alliance and the Center for 
        Urban Economic Development of the University of Illinois at 
        Chicago Data Center titled ``Home Economics: The Invisible and 
        Unregulated World of Domestic Work'' indicated poor working 
        conditions across the domestic workers industry. The findings 
        of such study included that--
                    (A) domestic workers have little control over their 
                working conditions, and employment is usually arranged 
                without a written contract;
                    (B) 35 percent of domestic workers interviewed 
                reported that they worked long hours without breaks in 
                the year immediately preceding the interview;
                    (C) 25 percent of live-in domestic workers had 
                responsibilities that prevented them from getting at 
                least 5 hours of uninterrupted sleep at night during 
                the week immediately preceding the interview; and
                    (D) 91 percent of domestic workers interviewed who 
                encountered problems with their working conditions in 
                the year immediately preceding the interview did not 
                complain about their working conditions because they 
                were afraid they would lose their job.
            (9) The study described in paragraph (8) found that 
        domestic workers have little access to federally supported 
        employment benefits. For instance:
                    (A) Less than 2 percent of such workers receive 
                retirement or pension benefits, and less than 9 percent 
                of such workers work for employers that collect payroll 
                taxes on wages paid to such workers to provide 
                eligibility for Social Security benefits.
                    (B) Sixty-five percent of such workers do not have 
                health insurance, and only 4 percent of such workers 
                receive employer-provided insurance, despite the fact 
                that domestic work is hazardous and often results in 
                illness or physical injuries.
            (10) Compounding these challenges is the fact that many 
        domestic workers have been, and in many cases continue to be, 
        excluded from key provisions of labor and employment laws like 
        the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 201 et seq.), 
        the Occupational Health and Safety Act of 1970 (29 U.S.C. 651 
        et seq.), and the National Labor Relations Act (29 U.S.C. 151 
        et seq.). Minimum employee threshold rules, misclassification 
        of domestic workers as independent contractors, and exclusion 
        of independent contractors from coverage means that most 
        domestic workers are also de facto excluded from Federal civil 
        rights protections, including protections under title VII of 
        the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (29 U.S.C. 2000e et seq.) and 
        other laws.
            (11) The International Labour Organization's Domestic 
        Workers Convention, adopted in 2011, calls for domestic workers 
        to have the right to freedom of association and collective 
        actions, protections against harassment, privacy rights, and 
        the right to be informed of conditions of employment. This 
        Convention also calls for the right of domestic workers to keep 
        their travel documents, the right to overtime compensation and 
        rest breaks, the right to minimum wage coverage, the right to 
        occupational safety and health protections, and mechanisms to 
        pursue complaints and ensure compliance with the law.
            (12) The unique nature of their work, in private homes with 
        individuals and families, also often makes it difficult for 
        domestic workers to use Federal programs and policies to 
        improve their skills and training and to join together 
        collectively to negotiate better pay and working conditions.
            (13) Many domestic workers are also vulnerable to 
        discrimination and sexual harassment. These issues are further 
        exacerbated by the unique working conditions faced by domestic 
        workers, such as isolation, poverty, immigration status, the 
        lack of familiarity with the law and legal processes, limited 
        networks for support, language barriers, and fear of 
        retaliation and deportation.
            (14) Millions of older individuals, individuals with 
        disabilities, and families are increasingly relying on domestic 
        workers. By bringing domestic work out of the shadows and 
        creating incentives and investments that help raise wages and 
        standards for domestic workers, the Federal Government can lift 
        millions of the most vulnerable workers out of poverty, reduce 
        turnover due to poor working conditions, thereby enhancing 
        quality of care, and support the millions of working and 
        retired people of the United States who rely on them.

                        of domestic services; and
                    (B) be construed to waive the rights or protections

                hiring entity not less than 1 hour of earned paid sick 
                time for every 30 hours worked, to be used as described 
                in paragraph (2). A domestic work hiring entity shall

                    (B) Dates for beginning to earn paid sick time and 
                use.--Domestic workers shall begin to earn paid sick 
                time under this subsection at the commencement of their

                as provided in this paragraph and may permit use before 
                the 60th day of employment.

                            (ii) Construction.--This section shall not 
                        be construed to require a domestic work hiring 
                        entity to permit a domestic worker to earn more 
                        than 56 hours of earned paid sick time at a

                    (D) Hiring entities with existing policies.--Any 
                domestic work hiring entity with a paid leave policy 
                who makes available an amount of paid leave that is 
                sufficient to meet the requirements of this subsection 
                and that may be used for the same purposes and under 
                the same conditions as the purposes and conditions 
                outlined in paragraph (2) shall not be required to 
                permit a domestic worker to earn additional paid sick 
                time under this subsection.
                    (E) Construction.--Nothing in this subsection shall 
                be construed as requiring financial or other

                hiring entity upon the domestic worker's termination, 
                resignation, retirement, or other separation from 
                employment for earned paid sick time that has not been 
                used.
                    (F) Reinstatement.--If a domestic worker is 
                separated from employment with a domestic work hiring 
                entity and is rehired, within 12 months after that 
                separation, by the same hiring entity, the hiring 
                entity shall reinstate the domestic worker's previously 
                earned paid sick time. The domestic worker shall be 
                entitled to use the earned paid sick time and earn 
                additional paid sick time at the recommencement of 
                employment with the domestic work hiring entity.
                    (G) Prohibition.--A domestic work hiring entity may 
                not require, as a condition of providing paid sick time 
                under this subsection, that the domestic worker 
                involved search for or find a replacement to cover the 
                hours during which the domestic worker is using paid 
                sick time.
            (2) Uses.--Paid sick time earned under this subsection may 
        be used by a domestic worker for any of the following:

                illness, injury, or medical condition of the domestic

                child, a parent, a spouse, a domestic partner, or any 
                other individual related by blood or affinity whose 
                close association with the domestic worker is the 
                equivalent of a family relationship, who--
                            (i) has any of the conditions or needs for

                        health condition or disability, that the 
                        domestic worker is required to attend; or
                            (iii) is otherwise in need of care.

                local law.
