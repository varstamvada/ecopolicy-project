                alien.
            ``(3) Use of labor through contract.--For purposes of this

        (c)(3)) appropriate documentation of such referral by such 
        agency, certifying that such agency has complied with the 
        procedures described in subsection (c) with respect to the 
        individual's referral. An employer that relies on a State 
        agency's certification of compliance with subsection (c) under 
        this paragraph may utilize and retain the State agency's 
        certification of compliance with the procedures described in

                was based and any additional evidence that the Court 
                finds was previously unavailable at the time of the

                compliance with the final determination in any 
                appropriate district court of the United States. The 
                court, on a proper showing, shall issue a temporary 
                restraining order or a preliminary or permanent 
                injunction requiring that the employer comply with the 
                final determination issued against that employer under 
                this subsection. In any such civil action, the validity 
                and appropriateness of the final determination shall 
                not be subject to review.
            ``(7) Creation of lien.--If any employer liable for a fee 
        or penalty under this section neglects or refuses to pay such 
        liability after demand and fails to file a petition for review 
        (if applicable) as provided in paragraph (6), the amount of the 
        fee or penalty shall be a lien in favor of the United States on 
        all property and rights to property, whether real or personal, 
        belonging to such employer. If a petition for review is filed 
        as provided in paragraph (6), the lien shall arise upon the 
        entry of a final judgment by the court. The lien continues for 
        20 years or until the liability is satisfied, remitted, set 
        aside, or terminated.
