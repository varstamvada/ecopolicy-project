        people:
                    ``An Israeli passport holder or a passport that has 
                an Israeli arrival/departure stamp.
                    ``Those who don't abide by the Saudi traditions 
                concerning appearance and behaviors. Those under the 
                influence of alcohol will not be permitted into the 
                Kingdom.
                    ``There are certain regulations for pilgrims and 
                you should contact the consulate for more information.
                    ``Jewish People.''
